In the United States, for example, or just Western liberal democracy in general, which I believe that we agree is kind of the scope of the debate, we can see that when we\\'re making policy that applies to the macro level, we absolutely need to know the wide scale objective changes that are going to occur as a result of our policy. One person\\'s experience in relation to this policy should not be something that outweighs the objective statistical values that are achieved through this policy. For example, one of the things that we\\'re doing right now is... An argument is common in America these days, to basically say that, \"Well, there are problems with this policy because it\\'s going to make life harder for a select few individuals.\" But they seem to ignore on the other side of that policy is that it\\'s making it easier for millions of Americans to live in a different way. I don\\'t have a policy to specifically list off the top of my head, but this kind of emotional manipulation is used in politics. Pathos is absolutely abused across the media where they\\'re talking about conservatives, republicans, or socialists and democrats.

Now, I don\\'t want to say that we should be accepting refugees in. It\\'s simply that they look at a situation and they say, \"We want to help out.\" Then when emotions are high, they make the decision to open their border completely. An example of this is in Germany. There are certain districts of the country that there is massive cultural clash because the Western liberal mindset of most of the people that live in Germany is clashing with a foreign culture that they\\'re not experienced with. This isn\\'t to say that either culture is bad. It\\'s simply saying that the cultures are less compatible than what is ideal. It ends up becoming a massive problem because there\\'s lot of cultural clash.

Then the narrative that's being pushed out today, which is like more data, more objectivity is better for any policy. We think that this looks like a model of utilitarianism and this is exactly what opposition is going to have to contend with. But what we do say and in our first point is the influence of perspective on politics. We say humans are naturally subjective creatures. The opposition is going to tell you that this is naturally a bad thing. What we tell you is this is important in so far as we need perspective on politics. We say our limitation is vastly depending on your background, especially of what type of arguments you make, but also specifically how you feel about those arguments and how you feel about that political debate because we think that this extends beyond the realm of just numbers and how this affects you on the economic level or how does it affect you physically. But we think that it also has some emotional and mental value in what politics actually does to you. We think that your ethnicity, your social economic background and the community that you come from, et cetera and your geography that you come from are all important factors in how you argue and also the perspective that you bring to politics itself. Because we do think that on a national scale, national scope, for example, federal level politics does play a huge role differently on how money gets allocated or how the impacts go depending on the geographic geography, but also the individual like the ethnicity, the socioeconomic background you have in relation to the government who is actually making these policies itself, who's having these political debates.\": [1,\n",

Because we don't think that first off, all of these people's subjective accounts can be taken out of the realm of these political debates. But even then we think that this pushes liberal policy more towards the fact that you're going to have people who are taking into consideration these subjective accounts and these people who have actually historically haven't had the voice in these political systems, but now with these subjective measures, these anecdotal evidence, they do have more of an effect on how the politics can be played out.\": [1,\n",

So even outside of the fact that if you get political change or novel, we do say, is that understanding the gravity of the situation or how it's being debated is just as important as understanding what the benefits and harms are. Because we say that the way you're being debated or the way that these communities are being talked about in the political realm is not currently how they want to be talked about. We think that you have much more ability for that community to actually change the political atmosphere and change how the political realm talks about them in so far as they are the ones who are having the narrative, having the ability to push out their subjective experiences, that they're able to have their anecdotal evidence actually used in this matter and understand the gravity of the situation. We say that finally, that the circle of empathy is essential for any political change. So we do say that, at the end of the day, the weighing mechanism you're going to be using, that the idea of the fact that even before we get any logos or we get any achievement or before we get any objective measure, what they have to understand is you have to care about the people that this is actually affecting in the first place. Because we say that the circle of empathy only relays to your friends, your family, and their closest people. However, what we hear is that from subjective experiences, you get more perspective and you get more of this idea of dignity and not impact.

When the status quo is working for you, you have new need to be emotional. Or on the other hand, if things are not going well for your group, because of massive oppressive institutions in your country, there's much more need to be emotional. I'll take you in a second, but why is this really important? Because we say people who are most at risk need the most to appeal and because they're going through the most visceral reaction, they have the most complex lives that can only be understood. No, thank you. Through the lens of their subjective own experiences.

People in a dominant group already have a blank check to be as racist as they want to the status quo because they're not being perceived as emotional. No thank you, it's also not your time. The only people who are perceived as emotional are the one who challenge it. Why is this important? Because this locks in Western status quo and countries and Western countries, it looks like the setting back of things like police reform because people who have the most to lose are always the ones who are in the most desperate situations. So they're seen as this. We're just why the American political compass is really, really okay of horrific things. Whereas that doesn't really happen in other countries, in weak democracies, this takes the place of truth. Minority groups demanding rights, being perceived as being a threat to stability of their fledgling political system. Because, even though their concerns are very be valid, because they've been gone lots of trauma and need to interject their own experiences for this trauma to make sense, they're going to be too emotional. This is why the U.S. and Western countries don't put pressure on terrible human rights abuses because they've perceived these minorities as being troublemakers and threats to order.

Housing is the best mechanism to accumulate wealth for the middle class and there are two reasons at least that they can't accumulate wealth easily through other financial assets.

       " {\"A little bit of weighing we would say that anger forces governments to create institutions to manage that anger. This is what comes out at the end of speech where he says that if you have a credible threat of people being angry and resorting to extra judicial means because their needs are not being met, that forces political systems to create institutions like courts that manage those conflicts in the long run. This is the most important issue in the route insofar as institutions resolve conflicts in the long run. So maybe emotional policies, let's take them at their best and say some emotional policies are created in the short run, but actually worse, they over-respond to subjective experience. But this is fine because in pluralistic societies we have a mechanism to negotiate those conflicts systematically between groups. So policies in the long run become more responsive because they're actually negotiating these conflicts. If you don't have a credible threat of anger, then elites are never incentivized to respond to the anger that exists in the majority, so these sort of angry things become prevalent in populous backlashes or extrajudicial means because they don't have a legitimate way of voicing their anger in the political system.\": [4,\n",

This definition, it means that more people are helped because public funds are sent to the public majority's as opposed to things like tax cuts because that's what elites think the facts say, is that the fact that we're going to help rich people by having this tax cut and because they preferentially weight those facts because that's what they think of objectivity is, it's elite-centric, that they're going to participate in those tax cuts more. Note that this also deals with OO, who says that sometimes subjective policy is harmful. We would also say that we mitigated this with the dog whistle analysis with regards to the racism stuff, but elite-centric policies always means that you help fewer people If we help more people with majoritarian policies, then we're helping more people definitionally.

It's not through that they're being put into an oppressive social relation. But second of all, we all have states in this, right? Insofar as if you have one religious group of being discriminated against at one time, you actually don't know what the discrimination is going to be 10, 20 years from now, insofar as government coalitions shift, individual prejudices shift. So if you justify it in the short term by saying, ah, maybe this group is more oppressive towards women, well then you set a precedent that 20 years from now that different group is going to be empowered and oppressed in a different way.\": [4,\n",

       " {\"Second thing we want to talk about is why the mechanism is uniquely good, why it's likely to be effective. So first of all, as I think op is going to agree to, this is a gigantic sum of funds. It's very unlikely that States are going to go against this insofar as their entire state economies in many instances are based in federal subsidies. Think about Iowa in terms of their other farm subsidies. We literally don't have the economy if the government, if the federal government doesn't intervene.

       "   'prestonj_round5']},\n",
       " {\"Number one is that it's impartial in a way state governments are not. So there's no particular ties to a certain ethnic group most of the time because they're heterogeneous across the entirety of the country. This especially matters in places with hot ethnic tensions and regional conflicts, so a country like Mexico for example, where there's a lot of state tension. It's very important that in Mexico specifically there is an individual regional government making decisions about ethnic and religious liberty and rather as the federal government which is agglomerated across all of these interests, they're a lot more likely to be protected in the general case.\": [4,\n",
       "   'prestonj_round5']},\n",
       " {\"Second, is that federal governments are directly bound to constitutions in a way that state governments are not. These constitutions, in most instances explicitly instantiate the right to religious liberty, but many state constitutions are not binding in the same way, or governments can just ignore them with more impunity. It's very important that we adhere to the federal constitution and liberal democracies, which protect religious liberties. But third, we'd say courts aren't as effective, so alternate mechanisms of enforcement aren't as effective. First of all, there's massive resource constraints, there's a huge time delay, regional problems insofar as court systems differ across States, so it's not clear that you actually establish a longterm precedent. We can also say that these mechanisms are also probably downstream of our policies so courts are more likely to be protective of religious liberty if that's the overall government policy.\": [4,\n",

       " {\"So first, why is this principally justified? We think that outward facing signs of the religiosity are critical to the functioning of the religion itself. That is to say that religious dress is extremely important to the individual expression of that religion. You can't separate the two. Religious signifiers are important for not just marking who's within the group, but also as an individual expression of identity, that I belong to that group in a way that other people do not.\": [4,\n",

You can wear the clothing that you want to wear. You can participate in religious holidays without fear that the government is going to crack down on you because you don't adhere to a certain model of what they think religion is. We also think that there's a gigantic downstream norm effect from the federal government.

We also think that you can't access postsecondary education if you've never built up those skills in the first place because your parents didn't read to you when you were two years old and you never built up those literary skills, and that vocabulary that you needed.

We think it reduces inequality between both We tell you that with post secondary education only those are able to access it in the first place are able to get the benefits versus early access to education.

       " {\"We also think this is really important in places like developing countries a little bit. We think that in school systems early on, especially in developing countries, sometimes you don't have that postsecondary access to education actually built in the system. So when you have students that are starting in the system, for instance getting used to going to a doctor and doing stuff like that because parents see there's low barriers to entry, they get into the norm of doing it which builds good skills later for life and that's allowed people to access the health benefits that I've already spoken about.\": [5,\n",

And we think it costs much less per student who'd be able to... make kindergarten for a lot of people and increase primary school access or give access to doctors for kids ages zero to five rather than trying to do it for a limited number of people when it's going to cost more per capita per student.

You also see greater equality for women, since the roles are not typically defined by healthcare since... childcare, since you are providing access to childcare and the cost is not prohibitively expensive for families.

But also the idea of community growth and education because the norm that is valued in the community, often times when it is not value before in the same way.

The second reason why we think that it\\'s more likely that elites will co-opt anger than activists will use anger to mobilize it is that there\\'s a bunch of examples out there and ones that we have given you about how in the past, subjectivity has been used to discredit valid and good positions. For example, climate change deniers look at the same facts as everyone else, but then manipulate those facts into the interest of the elite, which are oil corporations with large money and a lot of agenda setting power. We think that\\'s an example of how subjectivity is used to create terrible political and it\\'s been mobilized by elites. The flip side of this is that even when there\\'s a group of people who are super angry but don\\'t have any direction to direct their anger in. People like Trump or populists are able to take that anger and direct it towards a terrible cause like the immigrants from this country. The last example that I\\'ll bring up is how British colonizers in India created the modern day cast system by turning people against each other in order to create conflict between classes. This is an example of how subjective experiences were mobilized to benefit the interest of the elite, which is why we think that objectivity is better. Now, the last comparative between the probability of elites co-opting anger and the probability of activists using anger to mobilize is this that, if it\\'s the case that elites are going to discredit activist movements, we think that it\\'s better for activist movements to change their strategies, rather than just to feed into what elites want them to do.': [2,\n",

We think that every experience is necessarily subjective, because only one person cannot experience someone else's life. So every experience is subjective. But what it means for something to be objective is if many people have experienced the same phenomenon. So for example, even if my experience of of police being racist to me is a subjective experience, if millions of other people have experienced the same thing, then we can think police brutality is an objective phenomenon in America. So that's what objectivity means for us. So then that definition sort of takes up all these arguments made in the GW about how their responses to for example. They say that people like MLK were portrayed as crazy. We think that even if there's some strategization of MLK as being crazy or too violent, we think that the fact that the millions of black people or white people banded together and supported MLK, that proves that MLK's movement was actually an objective movement, which means that their responses do not apply or do interact with others.\": [2,\n",

It is trading off between assisting people who are already practically adults, we would say, in going into post-secondary education, at that time when they are adults, versus the trade out of supporting people who are adults, but at that time may have to take care of their own parents, have to work their own jobs, and potentially work on career advancement if they are trying to make a better life for their own children, and have to, on top of that, then take care of their own children.\": [2,\n",

Or that there are no community colleges. We simply have changed the funding priority. We also think that it's the case that employable people sort of fill these gaps in employment that they say don't exist, in order to fulfill the needs of early childhood care because of the lack of post-secondary education. It's precisely why that in order to have these benefits, we need the greater funding, in order to incentivize these people. Rather to flee the country, rather to go somewhere else, but rather to stay because there's a financial incentive to be a early childhood care physician, or psychologist, et cetera, or an educator in an existing country due to the priority given to this by the government in terms of funding. We think that creating this kind of financial incentive means that we solve for harm of lack of employability in these positions, that might be caused by an absence of post-secondary education, but also that post-secondary education at least the absence is mitigated by the fact that we aren't scrapping this entirely, and then just pressing to a sufficient degree that we can make up for in the long run the absence of having tons of early childhood care psychologist such that this becomes a lower cost in the longterm and we are able perhaps to shift priority later or to maintaining this priority but do so even greater effectiveness, creating even less educational inequity in the longterm because of the educational inequities that, as my partner tells us, start very early in childhood and therefore need to be resolved at that time.\": [2,\n",

Firstly, we think that this makes a loud minority deceive the majority into voting against their own interest. What government side has to support, in this case, is Trump and his fear-mongering strategy to get the majority of the population to vote against their own interest. It\\'s things like emotionalized experiences of crime and violence that take the status of Mexican immigrants out of context and say, \"This is what they are doing.\" And when people talk about personal experiences of having a crime done to them by a Mexican immigrant, that does not mean that that is a generalized truth in America in today\\'s world, right? But it emotionally moves certain people who directly perceive this as a generalized situation. We think that this deceives the majority into voting for policies that are not right for them. Notice the bias here. Positive emotions are far less effective in the political sphere than negative emotions. At the point in which personal experiences directly focus on negative aspects of certain immigrant populations or certain minorities, we think that this disproportionately harms them, to the exclusion of others. We think that it\\'s very hard to compare different personal experiences. That\\'s why voters can\\'t make an objective account in this case. The second harm that comes from personal experiences in political debate is that this pushes politicians to the extremes. That\\'s to say when emotions and personal experiences dominate political debate, every politician is forced to engage in that. Why? Firstly, just a large perception that this is somehow more powerful and persuasive to the public. But second, they want to avoid sounding really cold and calculating, at the point to which other politicians are talking about very personal stories, where you\\'re talking about numbers. Why is it incredibly bad? Firstly, you lose the opportunity to genuinely inform the politics and what policies each candidate stands for. Notice that publicized and televised political debates or other unique opportunities to actually inform the public on political issues and get them to be informed voters when they actually do elections. You lose this opportunity at the point in which you focus more on personal accounts and subjectivity, rather than actual facts and what policies each candidate stands for.': [2,\n",

Why is this so? Firstly, you focus more on the problem, rather than actionable solutions, at the point in which personal experiences largely serve to identify what the problem is in society. But secondly, you get less tied down by campaign promises, at the point in which publicized debates are focused less on making campaign promises and promising to the public, rather than just focusing on personal accounts and subjective issues that serve to try to move the public emotionally. Secondly, I'm going to talk about how this harms social groups that are involved. Firstly, I think you prompt the opposition parties to attack your experiences directly, rather than the policies that you stand for. There is a difference between attacking objective political preferences that you have and attacking painful experiences that are very integral to who you are. If you're a woman in the workforce who suffered from workplace discrimination or an immigrant who is refused service because of your race and your opposition party in these political debates say that your experiences are illegitimate or not what is largely true about the world, we think that that harms you personally. But secondly, an impact of that is you socially divide the populace even more, at the point in which the experiences that you as a member of a particular social group are more likely to have become politicized in and of themselves. Your party allegiance is directly tied to who you are and your identity, and that's more likely to segregate the voting population into different social groups who think that's terrible for the political atmosphere in the long term.\": [2,\n",

Why these weaponizing counter narratives not the biggest issue that we\\'re facing? Because first, I think that normative policy over increasing statistics is going to become a new norm. Notably a lot of policy is made by the rich and wealthy and racial majorities.

In a world of objectivity, that would never be a play, but when individuals are able to talk out and say, I think inclusivity is important. My lived experiences of being marginalized have been very harmful for me to get into the workplace, then I think then policy is going to change in a different way in which we no longer care about increasing efficiency. We are now turning towards a world in which we ought believe it should be. Statistics can\\'t tell us how we should go about that number. If we just try to increase efficiency, but using lived experiences allows us to contextualize what world we want to live in, not just how do we increase efficiency. I think that is incredibly important. This is why stories help the contextualization of our messages. This is why the minority populations are already...

Quebec only has a few cities that it can draw money from, but the entirety of Canada has multiple ports and other cities that they can take taxes from. Often these discriminatory laws are implemented in places that have less income and less money associated with them. That is because religious bigotry and other types of discriminatory behavior are often seen in these areas that don't have a lot of interaction and who aren't liberalized, who aren't like the coastal elite places.

As a result, they have these people who advocate for these anti-religious movements no longer have a justifiable destination they can point their followers to.

The only people in the status quo who are voicing concern about this policy is the religious minority themselves.
