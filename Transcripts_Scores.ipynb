We think this makes the voters more educated and the you get is not just like right-wing populace who have gotten really mad about something that was racist on Fox news for instance, or something that was said on a political radio, to be somewhere in the developing world and instead you get more issues of never working against the sensationality.\",\n",

I think when they say that Singapore is a bigger economy of the end of their case, talking about how they're going to have the most power recognize that's in the status quo within the framework of ACIAR but also they should have the ability to within ACIAR to descend and generally they need to reach a consensus but then secondarily even if they have more power comparatively they care more in our world because they're able to bail out those countries.

But secondly is the financing all things within using that currency, whether it's debt that they need to be using that currency for or whether it's going to be hurting international trade. All those reasons are why they care. The members of ACIAR grow to care about each other when they're tied together with a currency like the comparative is that China is much easier able to pick off countries like Vietnam, Cambodia because they put their individual interests over that of Southeast Asia. We tip that balance towards Southeast Asia rather than individual interests when they're having to go China because of the fact that they care about, they care more about the success in Southeast Asia. Another way in which we place a third way in which we increased the ties between Southeast Asian nations is that when you decrease the transactions costs of trade and we'll need to have more trade presents within ACIAR itself, that means you've increased the regional ties between each other.

       " {'text': \"So first, about better economic policy. There's largely two reasons you've got this. First is I think you're getting more investment and more trade just because there's a lower currency risk when you have a centralized currency. There's two reasons for this case. First, internally there are zero currency risk. So when Thailand is trading with Cambodia when a business is investing in Cambodia, it means that the business does not have to worry that Cambodia's currency will collapse and all of their profits go to zero in a particular year. So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.\\n\",\n",

That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability. That is to say, if there's more jobs for people, we think there's less political discontent.

Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.\",\n",

Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student.

You don't realize that your own experiences, that the staff that you see, the facts that you see are still only your subjective view and you are viewing the window through a lens of your experiences still. We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right. And that was the narrative given by society that was propagated as the truth. That's the one you run into. When people believe that their views are correct and believe that their attempts to reach objectivity have gotten them there.\",\n",

There are a variety of different problems and solutions that were derived in the world and that have come out of political debates that simply could not be informed by objective fact. If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world. A very good example of this is a study that was conducted and had qualitative methods that were used, focused on subjective feelings, about what the impact for Asian American immigrants was coming to United States. And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics? And you cannot answer that question by looking at objective fact. That is way too narrow and reductionist. So instead, what was done and which effectively proves the argument that we're trying to make today is, instead what happened was interviews were conducted, shared experiences were shared, and from that, a whole rich, thick set of data came out, and consequently informed in how to better, in an informing way, of us understanding the true impact of, for example, segregation and assimilation on Asian American immigrants.

YOu're not under the mercy of someone who can give you a notice, basically telling you that you have three months to find a new home with at a rate that you can pay.

       " {'text': \"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?\",\n",

But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

This is a protest movement where everyone rallied in the streets and they had drum circles going all day for weeks. There were people out camping. It was a huge protest movement, but it was ultimately unsuccessful because they failed to push their movement outside of the realm of emotion because people were hurt. People felt hurt because of the financial collapse, but they didn\\'t bring any substantive policy change, and so nothing happened. They relied too much on how the collapse made them feel rather than what they were going to do about it. So it resulted in basically only drumming and riots and a general distaste and anger towards the system that they were trying to protest. We also see this with commentators like Ben Shapiro who make their careers off of quote, \"Dunking on liberal snowflakes.\" These people use the emotions of their opponents, they cherry pick the people who are most emotional, who have the most emotional response to whatever he says. He makes them look like fools because their argumentation isn\\'t there, and then he profits off of that even though he doesn\\'t have to do any of the work.

So when you had those protests that were televised and the police brutality that happened, the movement was so focused on emotion and so unrelatable to most people in middle America who were seeing them on TV.

First is I think you're getting more investment and more trade just because there's a lower currency risk when you have a centralized currency. There's two reasons for this case. First, internally there are zero currency risk. So when Thailand is trading with Cambodia when a business is investing in Cambodia, it means that the business does not have to worry that Cambodia's currency will collapse and all of their profits go to zero in a particular year. So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.\\n\", 'score': 4, 'id': 'amspector100_round4'}\n",

That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability.

The people living in your area just at least see housing prices go up over time, indefinitely and permanently into the future.

Even if you come from a wealthy background and you've never suffered from political oppression, you can still understand what it feels like to be bullied or to be ashamed of some aspects as well, and we think this gives people who come from privileged backgrounds a greater capacity for political action and ability to empathize with people who are truly suffering from political oppression. \\nThis makes it easier for people from these backgrounds where they are oppressed, where they do suffer, to get society as a whole to mobilize on their behalf instead of only trying to make change themselves as minorities that are already disempowered.

We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right. And that was the narrative given by society that was propagated as the truth. That's the one you run into.

If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world.

And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics?

So you're already disadvantaged when you start, you're already behind. And that carries out through your entire education because generally this is a geographical issue. Many of the people with these problems are in the same area and they're going to the same schools. So you have an entire school of kids who are behind because they didn't have these early childhood programs. And so these areas and these demographics of people aren't going to have the same opportunity to get to college as kids from better off areas. So when we fund these sorts of programs, we actually get this solid baseline education for these children.

In our world, objectivity is not what's valued in debate. In our world, subjectivity is valued in debate.

      "{'text': \"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?\", 'score': 3, 'id': 'pmanisca_round2'}\n",

But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

My partner brought to you explicit analysis about how, when you have a home, you are no you are better able to get access to like loans, money stable like Elliot's liquid. He grants you all these amazing examples and all these details explanations about how this wealth transitions forward.

But I also think that there is a very real pragmatic argument about what effects on the ground are we how people react to that minority and how people react to the federal government. So Colin gave you this argument about how people would hate on the minority group because they are perceived as the group that drains on the resources of the state. They're response here is ah, well the state is going to change their ways so they can get more money. I think oftentimes there are extremist cultural practices all the time that they talk about such that the calculation isn't pragmatic to begin with it's not based on that.

That is to say, a lot of people in these states are going to feel aggrieved that the federal government has been unwilling to support them or has been willing to intervene in this particular way. So we think that for the anti-religious groups that you're talking about. They're likely to become a more extremist and more people in those states who may entice particularly religious but are aggressively in favor of the independence of states, now move their political attack.

What this actually looks like is giving Singapore an incredible opportunity to start doing things like predatory lending, like holding Malaysia accountable when they've paid for their roads or trains or whatever it is. Being that Singapore is really likely to use this as a bargaining chip for the rest of time, and this is probably really bad for those under developing countries.

We think that when Singapore sees that Thailand's not growing to the extent that they thought they originally would because of the austerity measures they've imposed, they're probably not going to want to stick to a coalition that's hurting them in the long run.
