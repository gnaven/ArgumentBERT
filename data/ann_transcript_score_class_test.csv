A lot of the American Dream, in a way, can be the idea of pursuing success in society. And I think that a lot of times, society at large has personified this achievement of success as owning property. A lot of immigrants when they immigrated to the United States sought to buy property, and that was how they seemed to have made themselves in society. This is something we haven't really grown out of. We think that a lot of society still views owning wealth as making it.

We think by saying that kids are special, we are acknowledging that there are different types of things that exist and there's not necessarily one right way. One quote unquote normal version one way that is better than another. This we see specifically from kids who struggle from physical and learning disabilities. By telling them that they're inherently special, it means when they automatically don't do as well naturally at school and have to struggle more, it's not telling them that they are worth less in society. It's telling them that there are different ways of doing things. People have different talents, different strengths and that they are not worthless because they are not automatically able to succeed as easily as their other students. The ideology of not saying that every kid is special in their own way, shows that there's just one way to be good, but if you say every kid is special in their own way, it shows that there are multiple ways to be good and this ideology of multiple ways to be good inherently boost kids' self esteem.

So they are told they're special, they're told their self worth and when they see that there are barriers holding them back to prevent that, they know it's not true cause they already have this really high self esteem. It was built up all through childhood. If you do not have this high self esteem, when they encounter these structural barriers, they're less likely to be able to effectively fight it. They might be able to fight it, but they're not going to have the inherit self worth that comes from being told that you're special. They're going to feel more passionately about the right to fight for inequality because they know it is intrinsic to their self and who they are because they've been told this throughout their whole life, slightly outside of activism, we believe optimism is inherently a good thing. So when you have, in our world, when kids believe they're special and believe they can work hard for things and if they work hard, you will get it. That is an optimistic role. In a ghost world, if they say that, okay, even if we work hard, we might not get what we want, that is pessimism, we think optimism is inherently better than pessimism because we'd rather have people try and fail and try again then not try at all and be dissuaded by that.

And so that's my idea about optimism. Try fail, try fail, try again rather than not try at all. We think people are going to be dissuaded to try. If they know that these structural barriers exist, they might be less likely to apply for riskier jobs, riskier promotions.

Different people are affected differently just by their circumstances, right? I think that when this happens, when you try to have this objective ideal, you tend to lose a lot of people coming in speaking about this policy and their effects on it. They tend to rely on these ideas of statistics, right? They tend to rely on this idea of physical...

When people see like a general trends, women who were in workplace having more leadership roles, they tend to overlook this emotional experience of women being harassed and still having this terror of bad experiences within the workplace just because they have this objective trend that, ""Oh, it's better than it was before.

They both believe their sides are the objective truth, and they tend to ignore that the other side's issues as being like more emotional or less based on fact. Not right now. But they're...

You learn Math, you learn all these essential things for you to set you on the right path in your next levels of education. You're also behind on an intellectual level. Because this is a place where, as a child, you are taught how to think critically. And we think that is important when you grow up. Because, let's remember that, for example, poor people are people who don't have access to these programs around the world. And those are also, for example, the people who don't vote. And as a result of that, what happens is that politicians who are being elected or not elected by them and do not work for them.

So that class disparity can be reduced if people are taught to think critically from the beginning. We're also, I should mention that we're also, subsidizing the work on childcare facilities curiculms. So, that will be happening. Also, as a result of this the impact of this is that you, if you don't go to these things, you are more likely to be less interested in secondary education anyways.

Because the front half talks about a lot about privilege and I think we agree on the metric that these children need to be able to have some sort of way of self fulfillment if they're going to be disadvantaged in the first place. If a parent, it's actually a strategy of parents who are foster parents and parents who have adopted children to tell their children, look, we actually picked you, you're special. We know that your parents might not have kept you, but we care about you, and that's the reason why you're here. And that's incredibly important for the emotional aspect of a child, especially when they're in a very formative period of their lives and trying to find some sort of meaning, something to claim to some sort of identity to belong with. Even if we don't fully define what kind of special means for different children. We think that children are willing to and more able to explore the different kinds of passions they have when they know that they're special, and they know that they're capable of achieving something, but furthermore, it's something that children can claim to, like we told you because if they have a passion, even if it's in astronauts or robotics, that's something that can possibly lead to them cementing longterm passions in their lives. At least to better treatment of other children. It also means they're likely to reach higher. Look, disadvantaged children are going to be disadvantaged when it comes to money on either side of the house. The difference is how they perceive themselves and how they perceive themselves going forward in their world when they, their future is a large question mark. We would rather not tell them look, you're going to be structurally disadvantaged and therefore you're less likely to succeed on the balance of probability.

So, kid is growing up in a new culture like a nuclear family, but in a family that's really controlling. That they inculcate this mindset that Hey, you're special, you're intrinsically beautiful and pretty much better than everyone else. Okay, So the kids have high expectations for themselves, but just as life wouldn't make it. They reach for high things and they fall short, but their parents are always there.

So now they go to middle school, they to go to high school, they don't really have the best habits, maybe they don't make a lot of friends. Maybe they don't ever pursue a romantic relationship. Because they're like, Hey, I'm unique, I'm special. Nobody wants to approach me, that I don't need to approach anyone because I'm already unique, I'm already special. Any mistakes that I make, any kind of lack of engagement is only because people don't really want to approach me. And that's their loss.

We think that this looks like a model of utilitarianism and this is exactly what opposition is going to have to contend with. But what we do say and in our first point is the influence of perspective on politics. We say humans are naturally subjective creatures. The opposition is going to tell you that this is naturally a bad thing. What we tell you is this is important in so far as we need perspective on politics. We say our limitation is vastly depending on your background, especially of what type of arguments you make, but also specifically how you feel about those arguments and how you feel about that political debate because we think that this extends beyond the realm of just numbers and how this affects you on the economic level or how does it affect you physically. But we think that it also has some emotional and mental value in what politics actually does to you. We think that your ethnicity, your social economic background and the community that you come from, et cetera and your geography that you come from are all important factors in how you argue and also the perspective that you bring to politics itself. Because we do think that on a national scale, national scope, for example, federal level politics does play a huge role differently on how money gets allocated or how the impacts go depending on the geographic geography, but also the individual like the ethnicity, the socioeconomic background you have in relation to the government who is actually making these policies itself, who's having these political debates.",constructive1,,vchaluv,round3,vchaluv_round3,0.0,73.0

Because we don't think that first off, all of these people's subjective accounts can be taken out of the realm of these political debates. But even then we think that this pushes liberal policy more towards the fact that you're going to have people who are taking into consideration these subjective accounts and these people who have actually historically haven't had the voice in these political systems, but now with these subjective measures, these anecdotal evidence, they do have more of an effect on how the politics can be played out.",constructive1,,vchaluv,round3,vchaluv_round3,0.0,73.0

We say that there is importance to having dignity and to having morality and for these people to actually feel that they do have this way, because they do have a say in the political government. So we say that the objectivity cannot cover all of these bases because we do think that if you pushed this narrative, the objectivity is the most important thing, then you aren't discounting the effect of dignity, of morality, and all these other non objective impacts that we get from inside government and all of these policies. Because we do think these policies have more impact than just the fact that you have more money, et cetera, et cetera. Because there are more impacts than just saying that there is some emotional value in taking care of yourself or saying that these politics actually matter to me. We say that the objectivity cannot quantify exactly how much this dignity matters to them and the only people that can actually quantify dignity are the people who get that dignity themselves. This is why subjective material matters. But we also say that in their world, they're talking about this idea of discounting subjective evidence. We think that this narrative that objectivity is the most important thing is what actually discounts objective evidence even more. We think that anecdotal evidence is more discounted when you say that objectivity is the most important thing.

So even outside of the fact that if you get political change or novel, we do say, is that understanding the gravity of the situation or how it's being debated is just as important as understanding what the benefits and harms are. Because we say that the way you're being debated or the way that these communities are being talked about in the political realm is not currently how they want to be talked about. We think that you have much more ability for that community to actually change the political atmosphere and change how the political realm talks about them in so far as they are the ones who are having the narrative, having the ability to push out their subjective experiences, that they're able to have their anecdotal evidence actually used in this matter and understand the gravity of the situation.

So we do say that, at the end of the day, the weighing mechanism you're going to be using, that the idea of the fact that even before we get any logos or we get any achievement or before we get any objective measure, what they have to understand is you have to care about the people that this is actually affecting in the first place. Because we say that the circle of empathy only relays to your friends, your family, and their closest people. However, what we hear is that from subjective experiences, you get more perspective and you get more of this idea of dignity and not impact.

So it's probably the case that I want my mother who is giving me physical care to also give me emotional care and to get me care in the sense that I can be whoever I want to be. But thirdly, we think children's generally are impressionable and since they spend the most time with their parents, they are going to be most impressive with what their parents think. And then on that point, we think a couple of things on how this actually manifests to change. Remember the link that... Or the link chain that Argent gives you, you internalize the message, you discover some sense of purpose down the line, and you have a trying for success. We think it is probably the case that not everybody's going to achieve every goal they've ever been told by their parent, right. But what is the actual impact of this? We believe children are more encouraged to try for the things that they would not have tried for absent the message that they could actually try and access the leavers of change. So what does that do? It's for somebody who was in a low-income situation being told they are smart. It's like applying for a scholarship to get into a gifted and talented school that takes them out of that resource-poor neighborhood. What does that look like for somebody who was artsy but doesn't have the capital to access art? They are told by their parent they can be creative and then they go and find ways to create a ways to be creative.",constructive2,3.0,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round6,ryanwilliamsdukedebate_round6,0.0,76.0
1760,"We just think that it manifests in different ways that are nontraditional, right? We believe that self actualization is important for a couple of reasons. Argent gives them to you. I'll run them through you quickly. The first is that people, when they internalize this message, are even more likely to try for success. We just have numerically more people who will be successful in whatever that field is. So it's not the case that we believe all children might become the President of the United States, but, specifically for minority children, we believe children who were told that... were being verbally reinforce that they deserve the basic standard of what everybody has as a society who would not have gotten that message regardless are now internalizing the fact that they deserve basic necessities and basic rights are more likely to fight for those. What are the tangible impacts of that? We believe even if you get very few success, those people can step into positions of power and change things for the children behind them. So, that is to say you have people like Barack Obama who was told he was special from a young age. They're encouraging me to actually run for president because I see somebody who has been reinforced and this message trickles down. But secondly, we believe you have better community building. So it's the same when you have people like little miss Flint who internalize the message that what they're doing is important. It can lead to better outcomes for communities and specifically those who are communities at risk. But even if that is you take off minority children, what happens to the rest of the world, right?

From there, they're able to not put themselves above others because they have felt shame in the past, and they know that they are not above other people and they're therefore able to go out into society and try to help their fellow person, their fellow human, to succeed in the world just like them.

Opening opposition, the impact that they give you is that children become entitled. They lash out, they get depression, and they feel pressure from their parents to succeed, which is detrimental.

We say that we have solvency for that because it's not actually that they have a failing economic sector, as it is not that their businesses are failing, it's that due to their political instability, there is economic instability in the area.

Why these weaponizing counter narratives not the biggest issue that we're facing? Because first, I think that normative policy over increasing statistics is going to become a new norm. Notably a lot of policy is made by the rich and wealthy and racial majorities. Meaning, if they are able to just keep using those statistics, keep saying, ""Let's increase our efficiency from 30% to 35%,"" and that is the only angle in which they're trying to achieve, this is particularly harmful because they're easily able to ignore all the minority populations that are also affected by these policies. What changes our government? We think that there was no statistic ever to suggest that having minority liberation and integrating a more inclusive workspace and having more inclusive hiring practices at all ever suggested that we've increased efficiency. In a world of objectivity, that would never be a play, but when individuals are able to talk out and say, I think inclusivity is important. My lived experiences of being marginalized have been very harmful for me to get into the workplace, then I think then policy is going to change in a different way in which we no longer care about increasing efficiency. We are now turning towards a world in which we ought believe it should be. Statistics can't tell us how we should go about that number. If we just try to increase efficiency, but using lived experiences allows us to contextualize what world we want to live in, not just how do we increase efficiency. I think that is incredibly important. This is why stories help the contextualization of our messages. This is why the minority populations are already...

They're not even a high school or college yet. Let them be dreamers.

Feeling value not only enhances your confidence and then when you go out in the world you're proud to present your ideas and show yourself and share yourself.

But if your parents tell you that you're special you're going to be like, ""Oh my God. Mom, dad, you're so nice. I really appreciate you. Thank you. And I really appreciate myself now because of you."" By feeling value you also share that value back, which I think is really important. Let's say an example, right? Your kid has a talent show. They're going to go on and sing and they're really nervous. They're like, ""Oh mom, I don't know if I can sing."" And they might not be Beyonce. Far from it. But if your parents tell you that you're a special person and we really believe in you, at that age you're not at the point yet where being an amazing singer is going to really make or break you. But, sometimes kids are afraid. They haven't experienced the world yet and they go to their parents when they need direction. And if their parents tell them, ""We believe in you.""

Maybe this shouldn't be that way."" Right? This leads to the generation of aspirational youth. It leads to people who don't accept no for an answer, but push to new frontiers. It leads to people who don't say, ""Why is there a problem in the world?"" But, ""How can I fix that problem?"" Right? That is the next generation of people that we want.

We are constantly trying to signal that we are a unique individual with a unique identity that is different and have something to offer to the world. The question that I think we all ask ourselves the most is, ""What is our place in this world? What am I meant to do and how are we going to fill it?"" So, we think that in society though, we're constantly deindividuating people, in schools and workplace and in our relationships. We are treated as nameless, expendable, and generic. We think for almost all people, they're probably going to end up with generic replaceable job. And they probably will be replaced many times in their lifetime. They're probably going to have to get multiple jobs in multiple different places, which we see. We also think with the division of labor that happens, you have a smaller and smaller swath of things that you focus on. And so you don't see the broader purpose of what you're trying to do.

It can work for the good of the country, as in actually acknowledging the structural areas, or it could be the other way and deny the good of the country and deny these structural barriers exist. We say with objectivity, you have a much more chance of acknowledging the structural barriers. So identity politics would become about branding. Elections would be based on this. Political discourse would become focused on experiences rather than policy. This will happen because politicians would be more concerned about building up their ethos over their policy and tearing down other ethos. Elections would become about who was a better candidate. Not in the sense of, are they going to do better things for our country, but who we'd rather want running us. And then their ethos would be elected. So politicians won't be seen as their idea, they'd just be seen as their sum of their experiences. Which is problematic in multiple ways. One, because politicians need to represent people who have different experiences than just their own. There are very few people who've lived the exact same lives as the politician has currently lived. So they need to be able to represent people beyond the scope of themself, have either had slightly different experiences or largely different experiences.Especially in terms of senators and the president, who have to represent large groups of people rather than just one rural community. And we think this is inherently bad. Because if politicians believe voters could only ... If voters believe that politicians can only support those who have identical experiences with them, this will decrease their faith in the government structure as a whole. They will have less faith that government can actually represent them if they don't see a candidate who is directly in line with their experiences, their emotions, their ideals.And if they have less focus, if they don't see candidates that can represent them and they see that, there'll be less voter turnout, there'll be just overall a falling down of government and ...

We see their experience portrayed an objective when nobody is objective, everybody is a sum of their life experiences, the interactions they have with other people in their lives, the events that they experience, their educational experiences. Everyone lived experiences and these things inform the kinds of political priorities people will pursue once they get into politics.

So it leads to a higher valuation of their experiences, which leads to better policy reform and more new wants to be, Cheryl People vote for people they think speak for their experiences. When the working class in America voted for Trump, who talked about America losing versus Hillary who would've had good policy for the working class but was seen as elitist. How does this get better at your side of the house? Well, we think that Trump got away with emotional appeals because he was seen as objective because of his white privilege and because of his high socioeconomic status he was able to talk with his issues and give out this illusion of I am looking at this subjectively from an expert opinion because of that privilege. That's not something that all people from marginalized communities get to use as a political tool. So yes. That's what we see on RSI. I said that I was on their side of the world. We have a world where people have lived, experiences are ignored while people who are usually the source of the problem that they are advocating for are seen as more legitimate because they're able to talk about these issues this passionately. If we go back to my example of racialized communities who have been brutalized by the police, they are angry about this issue because they haven't been deeply hurt by this issue. Rich, white politicians who are not hurt by this issue, are able to talk about these issues dis passionately because they don't have the same incentive to care.

We think that by equalizing this conception of self-worth up to what men already feel like they have, we think that these people are going to necessarily have more agency to advocate for themselves and advocate for themselves in institutions of power like the workplace and such because of the fact that their conception of self-worth is shifted.",constructive3,5.0,sirtylerli,round6,sirtylerli_round6,0.0,74.0

Now of course in the status quo, we can recognize that people who are different than us have human dignity. But the question is, where does that come from? Now, leading up to the Enlightenment, what we have is a narrative that is inherently subjective around political power. It is around...

The reason we like leftist opinions I think objectively and straight is because we think we're generally right about the world. We think that there is discrimination. We think there is sexism, we think there is all classism, but what structural aspects of personal narratives diffuse this, three. First, any argument against a personal narrative is then perceived as a personal attack. If you have someone whose objective, emotional experience is just like my family was attacked by immigrants and you're just like immigrants statistically don't really commit crime or the people, but, my family was attacked by immigrants. When you give that narrative the same emotional weight, comfortability and acceptance by like a swing voter who's just like, man, that statistic and like, God, I love this narrative. That is what results. If that's the case, then you get worse debate because you can't deflate narratives that are lies because you can't attack a narrative on its merits.

What does this result in? This results in perhaps a black girl who gets an F in her class thinking that I don't deserve to get this F because I am inherently special. But when she faces legitimate discrimination and she says, I don't deserve to be discriminated against, we think that those concerns are going to be conflated in a world of specialty. We think that it becomes easier to trivialize minority concerns on that point because children are generally made to feel they're inherently special. So whenever they're confronted with failure, they don't think that they deserve that failure. Therefore, when we have genuine concerns with regard to discrimination, it is easy to dismiss them because of the concerns that they raised which weren't genuine.",constructive3,4.0,saniairfan,round6,saniairfan_round6,1.0,77.0

Because we view it as a problem, and we think we see this with Warren and Kamala, who focus a lot on personal appeals and stories and are often dismissed for that reason: because they're not rational.

When your life is on the line, you can't see both sides. When your access to an abortion puts your autonomy at risk, you're going to be more angry about it.

Not every man should be able to get up and say their opinion on abortion is equally important, because it's not when it doesn't affect them and it doesn't have a direct impact on their lives. The same thing with cisgender people constantly speculating about the transgender community, who don't get their subjective experience at all.

1653,"First, three ways that ambitions are distorted in the status quo among young people. A lot of this applies to everybody, as well. The first is risk aversion. By default, most humans tend to be risk-averse. There has been substantial economic studies that people are more likely to try to avoid a possible harm than to seek a possible gain, even when the expected value of doing so would be lesser. But we think that by introducing a distorted view of the potential gains from hard work, you then account for that and shift the equilibrium towards one where people are working towards their expected value as a person. Secondarily, we think that people tend to remember fear more than they remember success. That is that if you have something very traumatic to you happen ... If you're up there at the top of a spelling bee and you can't remember how to spell the word cauliflower, third grade was rough. You remember that all the way until you're giving a speech at HWS. But if we can introduce some kinds of successes, they're less likely to stick with your memory. You forget your successes from a week ago and you're already focused on your problems. Third of all, we think that the incentives for competition, the other actors outside of the individual, can distort or deceive them. This is kind of what I mentioned in the opening about test-takers. There's often an incentive to make it seem as if you didn't work as hard as you do or to try to convince others that they're not worth as much as they are. Secondarily, we think it's really important to note that increased ambition actually does lead to increased success among young people. Two reasons. One, we think that in many domains, hard work is sufficient to achieve a certain amount of success. Even if somebody is super unathletic, if they spent enough time in the gym and enough time at practice because they believe they're special, the extra five or 10 hours that they're spending per week is going to be sufficient to make them at least moderately successful.

It's possible there are diminishing marginal returns, and we're open to that, but more trying is never going to make you less successful in the vast majority of situations. Now, there's probably, we think, two categories of impacts to people being higher ambition. The first are external impacts, the way the people being more ambitious help people besides them. The main idea here is we think that when you make people more ambitious, they're more likely to make meaningful contributions in various career paths, particularly in areas in which the probability of being successful in a given field is so low that it would be irrational for any individual to think, without some kind of distortion, that they would be able to contribute to that kind of a field. We think that these types of outside narratives are actually oftentimes a prerequisite to be able to achieve that kind of progress. Imagine entrepreneurs, for example, where the percent chance for the start-up succeeds is oftentimes less than 10%, depending on the region. The percent chance that your idea was actually valuable was even lower, and even if you think that your idea is good, there are plenty of statistics available, but the vast majority of people who think that their ideas are good actually don't have good ideas. This is where we think the parents can play a moderating effect. We think it makes it more likely, then, that we have people that go into ambitious scientific fields to tackle problems that we consider to be intractable in the status quo. This, we think, is the tipping point of where somebody who is already going to be a scientist decides to try to solve some form of cancer, rather than trying to find some kind of niche area that's not going to impact that many people but might be easier to solve. We think this is the difference between somebody who would otherwise go and start a small business in their town, instead trying to start a large social movement or start a large entrepreneurial business. All of these things, we think, are hard to quantify the exact impacts of, since they're so diverse, but are likely to have substantial positive spillover effects.",constructive2,5.0,thecactus,round6,thecactus_round6,1.0,79.0

We think that people are oftentimes going to be sad for failure, but the key difference here, we think, is that people were also sad from the lack of trying something. We think this is why you probably prefer [Doug 00:06:14] [Bench 00:06:14] on this issue. That is, if you never actually try something when you're 40, I think that's when you have a mid-life crisis and realize you haven't really done anything with your life. I think that's likely to be a more sustainable kind of this happiness than the other types that we see. But this also gets more pernicious as you move outside of the general population or outside of everybody possibly affected. Two groups, we think, are of particular interest. One, we think that minorities are likely to have disproportionately distorted beliefs about what they're able to achieve. So any of the impacts we've talked about, how other people were having their views moderated, are likely to be exponentially more important for minorities. We think that a similar process applies for those who have learning impairments or those who are differently-abled, because they're no longer able, in many cases, to meet societal expectations of what society would say constitutes success or being special. And therefore, oftentimes the only meaningful indicator that they're able to achieve of personal success and happiness comes from others in their life who tell them they succeeded, even when the rest of the society doesn't. And we think that is the role that parents play.",constructive3,5.0,thecactus,round6,thecactus_round6,1.0,79.0

You put up the posters you like, you bring in the furniture that you want.

So what do we say some of the deep harms of renting are? So first let me say, there's a sense of servitude inferiority that unfortunately comes with something that is so intrinsic to your identity that it's essential to your sense of self, being put under the control of someone else for no better reason than that they were born into money and privilege in most cases. We see that people who do not have money are forced to tie something fundamental to their identity, fundamental to their life, their home, and put it under the power of somebody else. So that just tells someone that things which important to them and their identity can be controlled by someone else. They don't have full control over things that they care about.

So we tell you that they aren't able to solve the problem of housing ability on their side of the house. How do we solve housing affordability for real? So we say there need to be aggressive zoning reforms, tax credits to development, et cetera, that need to be led on a national level further from local influences. This is what was done in Japan. And they say that in the developed world, the rate of inequality and housing prices are increasing in every society, but that's not true.

So, for example, people from China buying property in Canada, which we've seen in places like Vancouver, which raises the average price of homes for everyday citizens. So what do we have now... What do we have in a system without this taxation?

So what we see with this taxation is that foreign buyers are de-incentivized for buying these houses, leaving them completely vacated. And now they'll have to, if they do buy these houses, pay more money towards the average Canadian citizen, which can go towards social services, despite what opposition says.

Yet people who are wealthy can evade taxes by putting their income into real estate, which ultimately again hurts lower income people. If you are putting that money that you make into investments, that is not money that's going to be taxed. So that is less money going to the overall population, the average Canadian citizen, if we're talking about Canada in this situation.

This is incredibly important because we recognize that, when we live in certain worlds, where you are born with certain privileges, you reject the idea, and you live in a world where you don't understand other people who are not so privileged. We recognize that like a majority of the rich people don't have a good understanding of welfare, and that welfare is, there's a lot of problems with, with issues involved with. So what that means is that these people who actually are living in those conditions that are under like social policy, but who live at other social support systems that currently don't actually who are, which is very, which have a lot of systemic problematic issues aren't able to help these people out. So we recognize that current problems with welfare include, one, you have to, there problems with welfare, you have to fill out, Those processing times can take like two months, all the way up to like two something years.

And recognize the only through personal stories and explanations as to why these social issues are, why these policies are currently backed through personal experiences can actually bring about light and problems that are problematic inside our society. So when we also improve, we talk about personal emotions, we also not only help people with welfare, it also helps people that are in the minorities that are affected. We recognize the reason why this helps the minorities is because, it's because people are empathetic. People recognize emotion and that's the only one thing that actually relates people to each other.

593,"like minorities, that are directly affected, and that results in better policies being made. Let's talk about some refutation that we, from what we heard from opposition. Opposition give first, tries to give you the idea that politicians do stories to sort of hide their policies. We recognize that that's it, versus let's say inherent assumption. The reason why we think that's an assumption is that we, politicians, we believe, that have the general interest of the public at their hearts. But the reason why they do, is because they need folks to win. So what that means is that they generally are ready, try to propose policies and changes that really affect, are beneficial to those. They're incentivized to create policy that are beneficial to the people, to the voter base that they're emotionally engaging with. We think that, on that I know like that point falls. So then they tell you that even if, politicians will hide sources. So even if we buy their argument, why do we recognize that this is still, this still doesn't really make that much sense. We recognize that because if policies don't actually make changes that affect the people on the ground, we recognize that these politicians will lose support from the population and from the public and there'll be voted out through the next election. So even if that happens, we still, we don't, we still don't think that their point really stands. I mean we give you the example of the ideas like of Trump appealing to candidates in the Rust Belt. So we recognize that Trump actually correctly identifies for the issues, people are losing jobs in the Rust Belt, people are losing manufacturing jobs. And so those are legitimate problems that people can identify with. And he used strong emotions to be able to connect with these people. What did we hear from the Democrats? They did not actually engage with these people's response. They tell you people was that America's already great. And what that means is that people were not looking into her policies and stuff like that.

What we also think happens is that because housing is, no thank you, is going to be taken over by these larger corporations that are much more incentivized to make sure that rent prices stay low. We told you two reasons why this is true. One, they're going to want to make sure that a lot of people come into their housings, so, they're going to want red prices to drop.

They're more likely to react in a hostile way to any further attempts to take away their incomes. Things like increasing public housing funding or things like welfare initiatives that make healthcare cheaper for the poor population. Recognize that the rich often have the most political capital in these communities and have the power to lobby governments both local and federal. The takeaway from this argument is that this punitive measure may be effective in the short term, but it takes away the ability to help the poor in the future, in an indefinite future where we can help the poor by having governments that can offer policies that are less intrusive to the rich, while also helping the poor and middle income populations",constructive4,,andrewyun7,round1,andrewyun7_round1,1.0,77.0
1682,"parents strains the relationship between parents and children. And this is the idea of teach versus tell. But that also goes into the point that C.G. made, saying that children are special in different ways. They're told they're special as a reaction to past success and actions. So if you're smart and you're talented and people are always telling you that you're special and that you should do this or that when you grow up, that is a pressure that's placed on you, that forms a barrier between you and the rest of the world because you are acting as a lone agent in trying to accomplish this goal when you might not have the ability to do so. And this is the idea of teach versus tell, going beyond the idea of specialness. So when Amy talked about teach versus tell, she was basically saying that instead of telling your children that they're special and telling them that they should be accomplishing the most incredible feats that humans are capable of, like is often implied in this term, she's saying that we should be going beyond that and teaching them to live lives that are more fulfilling than the idea that they should have certain goals. This results in burnout, either because of lack of talent or talent limit, just not being able to progress as far as some other people are, or disinterests. So a lot of people when they have their idea of specialness instilled in them, when they start dance, when they're five years old and they go all through high school and their parents say, ""Oh, you should be a famous dancer one day. You're going to be a professional dancer."" That often declines in time over interest. And so a lot of times people lose their idea that they can be worth anything if they aren't focusing on the ideas that they go through when their children... Yes. I don't think that that's necessarily true because even if you tell a child that they're special, it doesn't mean that... If anything, it puts more pressure on them.

When you grow up doing a certain thing, like if you grow up in theater and you're always getting roles and everything and you go off to theater school and then you can't find a job outside of that, that causes inherent harm. People have told you all your life that you can be special because you have a talent in whatever you're focusing on.

There's no conceivable way when the unified Michael, all of these countries can, it can possibly posture against China weight, it will be successful. What's likely to happen is that this seems to posture against China and China will react. I didn't get much more difficult for these countries to prosper. For example, you'll see them asking for debt collection faster and more likely, right, to be more harsh to these countries in terms of knocking, not giving an aid. That sort of thing, if we're likely to see is that China is going to react very negatively in a way that actually has a hurting these countries in the long run. Right. So the red, the, the, the basic end of this principle is that what's going to happen is that China is, is great. China already has a lot of economic power. That's true. Both worlds.

Now next, let's talk about marginalized kids. So if a child is marginalized, it's just an inconvenient, sad, unfortunate truth that they will have to work harder than anyone else to succeed and will face huge obstacles, not just to become a successful superstar, but just to pull their way into the middle class where they can live a dignified life. Where they can have enough food, things like that. So they need to be conscious of the need to work hard to succeed. If they're given the impression that they have natural good luck, that they have natural talent that will make them less likely to put in that effort, that will make them less likely to go above and beyond and do more work than their classmates and partners do, we think that's going to make them more likely to fail. So now, if you have average kids who are completely middle class who have enough food on the table, have a comfortable life, and are capable of happiness, but at the same time have some disadvantages, some drawbacks, we still think there are many universal things that apply to rich kids, poor kids, and to them.

So essentially what we're bringing this down to and what applies for all children, is that on their side, your intrinsic formation of identity, of who you are, what is important to you is 100% based on your success at the things parents choose for you and your parents might choose what they think you'll be good at as they're living vicariously through them. They want their kids to be good at something cause they always wanted to be in the football state championship and never work. Their parents might literally just be wrong cause they don't have as complete information with that child as they do. We should let children grow up and decide what they want to be good at and what they want to tie their identity to on their own. We don't think that this is impossible. So the main problem is that on their side of the house, happiness is conditional on success. We say that happiness should be conditional on having a decent family life, on having enough food, and living in a decent worth. So in the words of Syndrome, if everyone is special, no one is.

So let's look at their courts and what they actually do. First when they told you that when you expose the atrocities that's where the passions are inflamed, well that's exactly what the courts do, right? The court and all the specific atrocities that happened, about the specific people who were murdered. We tell you that this is more likely to result in by the victims. But secondly what courts do, they largely answer positive questions around what happened, questions about what should we do for the future. Because the way a court functions, it tries to find out what the truth is and does it find someone guilty or not guilty. What we instigate on our side is that we get recommendations, so instead of looking at the specific events that happened, the specific instances of murder. It is sufficient for us to know, that there was mass murder and then we look at the causes of it. That is the purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Committees.

This is the point at which you reprisal from the victims, this is the point get popular unrest, popular rioting, popular mass murder. But also notice that the perpetrators also have their own supporters, right? This is the nature of and living by polarization in the society. And these are people who are pronounced as national heroes by their own supporters, like in Yugoslavia. When you put these people on trial, when you try to tell their supporters that these are the worst criminals and these are abhorrent individuals, this is the point at which you don't get reconciliation.

That is the impact of the extension that Cojay brings to you that goes under addressed by the other side of the debate. So this idea of the narrative being skewed is especially important because on their side of the house people never actually engage with power structures. At best they engage with lived experiences to some extent, but they don't know why they should care about those lived experiences. There're no mechanisms to couch those lived experiences in the context of the larger structure of society and why we should therefore make a change. What do we hear from the government? We say people are just less likely to use emotion because they think their emotions and themselves are now valued less. But we think it's probably worse if you just stop using facts. Because then political discussion just goes absolutely nowhere because it's just people claiming victimization on both sides of the house and it doesn't actually go anywhere and nothing is passed. But second, we think it's too visceral. For the reasons that people are always going to bring their emotions into it. So emotion never completely disappears. The trade-off argument that they present is just not true.",constructive1,4.0,adijk,round3,adijk_round3,1.0,78.0
1292,"A little bit of weighing we would say that anger forces governments to create institutions to manage that anger. This is what comes out at the end of speech where he says that if you have a credible threat of people being angry and resorting to extra judicial means because their needs are not being met, that forces political systems to create institutions like courts that manage those conflicts in the long run. This is the most important issue in the route insofar as institutions resolve conflicts in the long run. So maybe emotional policies, let's take them at their best and say some emotional policies are created in the short run, but actually worse, they over-respond to subjective experience. But this is fine because in pluralistic societies we have a mechanism to negotiate those conflicts systematically between groups. So policies in the long run become more responsive because they're actually negotiating these conflicts. If you don't have a credible threat of anger, then elites are never incentivized to respond to the anger that exists in the majority, so these sort of angry things become prevalent in populous backlashes or extrajudicial means because they don't have a legitimate way of voicing their anger in the political system.",constructive1,,prestonj,round3,prestonj_round3,1.0,79.0
1293,"But even if this doesn't happen, we are still coming out on top, two reasons. Number one is that policy is less-elite centric. This definition, it means that more people are helped because public funds are sent to the public majority's as opposed to things like tax cuts because that's what elites think the facts say, is that the fact that we're going to help rich people by having this tax cut and because they preferentially weight those facts because that's what they think of objectivity is, it's elite-centric, that they're going to participate in those tax cuts more. Note that this also deals with OO, who says that sometimes subjective policy is harmful. We would also say that we mitigated this with the dog whistle analysis with regards to the racism stuff, but elite-centric policies always means that you help fewer people If we help more people with majoritarian policies, then we're helping more people definitionally. Second is we're likely to create strong law that can be reformed, so even if you get some bad laws in the short term, we're likely to reform these things in the long run.",constructive2,,prestonj,round3,prestonj_round3,1.0,79.0
1456,"how you see the world, but it compounds over time because it affects, literally, everything you learn. Literally, every social norm you see, you interpret through your own experience. It might start out pretty harmless as, ""I want to be on the soccer team,"" but eventually you start to believe things like, ""Oh, my preferences should be expressed by the government because I am special."" But, lastly, we also think this changes the way that people value success. That is to say, you learn to measure success as a differential. That is to be good. The encouragement you're seeing from an early age is to be better than someone else. So we think that you're more likely to focus on beating other people as opposed to just doing good things in the world. You're more likely to think, ""Well, if I want to live up to my parents' expectations that I am special, I have to be better than the other kid in my math class,"" as opposed to just thinking, ""Oh, it's good enough as long as I got an A minus or an A on the test."" So, what is the impact of this? We think, first, this just means people are worse to other people. Because they see themselves as better, they see themselves as deserving more, and, as a result, they're less likely to see other people as fully human as they are. And this is, yes, likely to be implicit because parents are, admittedly, going to, probably, try to prevent their kids from being full on racist on either side of the house, in many households. But, we think that this perniciously changes the way you view other people in lots of different interactions. Biases and racism are implicit, and they only get worse if you see yourself as special, if you see yourself at the top of society. And this outweighs all of the arguments government makes because, even if kids are more successful, it does not matter if they use that success to do things that are bad for people or if they do not give back to society. If you make a lot of money, if you do not give to charity, I don't frankly care. I think you're probably contributing to wealth [in the world 00:05:47].",constructive1,3.0,amspector100,round6,amspector100_round6,1.0,82.0
1457," But now, let's go to the second argument: about how you try harder and learn better on our side of the house. So, first, I think we're going to argue that kids learn that talent is innate, if parents tell them they're special, that if they're different than other people, right? So, we think that the moment you fail, either one of two things can happen: either your parents will start to seem less credible and you won't believe that you're special, which means, by the way, your relationship with your parents will get worse, or, alternatively, you'll think, ""I can't have failed because I am special. It is not me, it is the system that is the problem."" And either way, we either think you learn to give up or you don't actually learn to learn from your mistakes because your parents have not told you the truth, which is that hard work pays off, that, even if there are differences in any talent, hard work is the thing that, actually, will determine your success in life. Instead, they have told you that you are special and you don't actually learn to change your actions. But, second, we also think that you're not going to, necessarily, make bad decisions to begin with. If you think you are special, you're more likely to think, ""Well, since my parents love me so much, I must be really good at dance, so I don't need to practice before I get on the dance team."" And this interacts with the arguments OG gives you about people trying things they like. We think that you're more likely to be unprepared when you try them and become discouraged in the first place, if you do not believe that actions are the root of success, if you believe that there's something innate about yourself that your parents have taught you, right? So, if you want other people to be more successful in life, if you want them to try harder, we think that you should teach them that they should try, right? That they should actually do a lot, that they should work on to improve themselves, they are not inherently special and as a... [",constructive2,3.0,amspector100,round6,amspector100_round6,1.0,82.0
1255,"How many mothers who have actually had their children separated from them do you see? Very few. Typically, the people you see are privileged people who were born in the United States, who are American citizens, never had to migrate in search of a better life, talking abstractly about things they don't really have a personal understanding of. The people who are excluded from the debate, the actual people suffering from separation at the border have two important characteristics. Firstly, they bring the most important unique perspectives to the debate. We say that they are the people who are able to share stories that aren't necessarily found by the media that aren't necessarily found by independent investigators. They are able to share personal experiences that no one else has access to. Secondly, we say they're the most important, motivated advocates in order to solve this problem. They're never going to give up to solve a problem that deeply personally affects them and their quality of life. Where someone for whom that problem is merely academic may be willing to just give that up. Thirdly, we say they are the most effective communicators to motivate public change on this issue. Why is that the case? Because we say that they are able to use their emotions, which are a universal language that all human beings share to share the depth of the severity of their experience with others. Even if you come from a wealthy background and you've never suffered from political oppression, you can still understand what it feels like to be bullied or to be ashamed of some aspects as well, and we think this gives people who come from privileged backgrounds a greater capacity for political action and ability to empathize with people who are truly suffering from political oppression. 
This makes it easier for people from these backgrounds where they are oppressed, where they do suffer, to get society as a whole to mobilize on their behalf instead of only trying to make change themselves as minorities that are already disempowered. These three characteristics, we think, make it absolutely essential that people who may not necessarily be able to stay calm in a debate be part of that debate. Expectations that exclude them from the debate have to be removed from society.",constructive1,,rowanley,round3,rowanley_round3,1.0,79.0
1256,"Now, secondly, we tell you that anger and all other emotions have vital functions in the public sphere as a motivator of action. Understand that political systems act on mandates from the public, the political system responds to demands on it that are made by the public. We say that without anger, it's far more difficult to get action on issues that matter to people and it is particularly more difficult to get urgent action.
We say firstly, that minority groups who face disproportionate disadvantages due to their smaller sizes and a greater political disempowerment and lower political influence, need the use of strong emotions to break through the barrier of apathy that many of the general public feel about things that don't impact them. They need to be able to share with people emotions that they can relate to in order to break down the sense that something is not a personal issue to someone. When you relate an issue to personal feelings that someone has, maybe about other things in their past, then you're able to make that issue somewhat personal to them. You can make the separation of children deeply personal to someone even who's just experienced the frustration and anxiety like losing their children in the mall for a few hours. Obviously it's not emotion to the same depth, it's not the same kind of pain, but they can at least relate to the fact that's a painful, difficult experience and they can see that had they been born in someone else's shoes, it could have been them.

You can twist it and use logic to come up with almost anything, but it's very difficult to emotionally justify why it is acceptable to separate children from their parents.
We stated the use of emotional motivators, of saying if something is deeply affecting you personally, it needs to change immediately, can break through gridlock that doesn't allow urgent action to be taken. We say this urgent action is absolutely necessary to make sure that real, immediate human suffering is resolved and more abstract issues like the financial problems of pension plans can maybe be dealt with in a calm way at a later date because they don't have the same kind of urgency associated with them.",constructive3,,rowanley,round3,rowanley_round3,1.0,79.0

It's very important that we adhere to the federal constitution and liberal democracies, which protect religious liberties. But third, we'd say courts aren't as effective, so alternate mechanisms of enforcement aren't as effective. First of all, there's massive resource constraints, there's a huge time delay, regional problems insofar as court systems differ across States, so it's not clear that you actually establish a longterm precedent.

You can wear the clothing that you want to wear. You can participate in religious holidays without fear that the government is going to crack down on you because you don't adhere to a certain model of what they think religion is. We also think that there's a gigantic downstream norm effect from the federal government.

We think that this also looks like subsidies for housing and for the jobs you would otherwise have to take while being in school, which is a problem that student loans don't fix for on their side of the house. So note that, then, I think what you end up is being able to see ... you're no longer looking at, as a parent, the calculus being that the ability for your kid to get into post-secondary school is dependent on the whims of the market and your job status as a parent at the point where they graduate, right? It's something you can financially plan for for the future, set up that it's actually feasible, and then also give your kids the ability to then, not just in that interim period from five yeas old to graduating, actually makes my ... actually have the chance to address.

So this also looks like teachers putting effort into you, more so if you're lower-income, at presenting, obviously, coming to school not in super-nice clothes, because schools now pressure them to because they care about their graduation record and they can't just have that be assured, saying ""oh, yeah, 90% of our kids went to Harvard, and those are all the rich kids, they'll be fine"" if it's not necessarily true that money is the only factor depending whether or not you get into a good school.

798,")kay, getting in toward our first point of constructing, why do middle-class people buy homes in the first place? Not necessarily just because some people are greedy and want more space in their home, but it's the idea that you could have a generational piece of land that you can maybe pass down to your children. Or at the very least, once your children graduate school and leave the house to go to university, you can downsize your house, sell the excess money from there, and then use that extra money that you made in the property appreciating over your lifetime to move into a retirement home.",constructive1,,coreyd405,round1,coreyd405_round1,1.0,77.0
799,"I think that this is a major way of why people buy houses in the first place, because land is a tangible asset that isn't going anywhere. It's not like a stock or 401k where these values could randomly draw. You know, at the very least that if you own a house for 30 to 40 years, that when you reach retirement, there's going to be some semblance of value that you can cash in on and be able to push yourself forward. So the question here now is, what does the new wave of how families spend their money look like? I think in this system, when you're disincentivizing house ownership, this also includes condos and all of that, you're just like forcing people to live inside apartments where they're necessarily constantly paying rent to: a. Either a private landlord who already owned that property, or b. Government assisted housing and hoping that the money you're giving to government assisted housing is going to have some sprinkled down effects for policies that might not necessarily benefit you.",constructive1,,coreyd405,round1,coreyd405_round1,1.0,77.0

Or rather than that money going back into their families and being able to invest in those family's futures, it's now probably going to a baldy landlord who already has a robust amount of capital just off of the virtue that these landlords already have the money to own these buildings in the first place. I don't think we need to necessarily prioritize them.",constructive1,,coreyd405,round1,coreyd405_round1,1.0,77.0

And I think a very large factor that leads to how large the middle-class family of a country is going to be, is how many mechanisms of investment do you give that family to further their future? Disincentivizing home ownership takes away one of the most classic ways that people view investments. You also need to realize just the socioeconomic biases that happen, that not everybody has an investment degree in finance, that most people only see their way of being able to invest and get ahead of their future is being able to own land in that way.

And Toronto, we call it the greater Toronto area, where there's been multiple suburbs that have been growing over there. The main mechanism in which suburbs grow is by people buying homes, and people needing new neighborhoods to slowly expand into there. I think when all of a sudden you're incentivizing people to not own home ownership, and the reality becomes that more people are going to be living in densely populated apartment buildings, you're slowly going to see, you're going to see the expansion of the suburbs slowdown.

So let's talk about how developing companies get funded. There's two things to that. The first is they often sell a lot of homes before they are even built, primarily to people who are looking to invest in multiple homes as a means of funding the production and creation of the rest of the markets that they are building. They do this because they don't want to use their own cash injections into this because they want a security that they will let the very least have made back the cost of production on all of these homes.",constructive1,,ecurry,round1,ecurry_round1,1.0,82.0

Meaning, to wait to people to accumulate the amount of assets necessary in order to purchase this house. So, what changed on their side of this debate is first of all, these corporations are less likely to build houses because the very people who are likely to fund the construction of this are now a lot less likely to purchase these homes in the very first place, which means housing is a lot less likely to be created.

Other things that are likely to happen, that I think are bad, are just that it means that less housing means people can't move across the country if they feel like it is necessary for them to do so or they can't move to communities where it is more economically advantageous for them to do so, but also it means that rental agencies, who own most of these houses, get a lot more sway in local politics in terms of what kinds of construction are much more likely to happen.",constructive3,,ecurry,round1,ecurry_round1,1.0,82.0

The reality is that this is punitive and aggressive towards them, but notice, housing is bubbling right now. People are already getting priced out of the market because they can't afford to do so because the price of housing is going up. If you put any amount of tax, it is a means of penalty towards them.
