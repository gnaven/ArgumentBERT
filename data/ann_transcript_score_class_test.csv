1500,"the greatest scientific and artistic developments throughout history have been from special people, people who are able to take disciplines that are usually not matched together and have been able to mix them together. Now what do I mean by this? Let's take an example like, I don't know, artists who come from the LGBT community. By taking their ability to succeed as artists, the skill that they have developed, and mixing it with their personal identity, they are able to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts, an artistic piece that is unique. And so that is an example of how telling kids how they're special, and trying to find the different ways in which their personal identity intersect, to create something which no one else could create, could lead to something like artistic development. Because someone may be able to create a great piece of LGBT art, but if they lack interest in a wide variety of fields they might create something specific to themselves. Something that a kid from a white community creates for LGBT art will always be different from something a Black kid creates and so on. And another thing that should be kept in mind is the idea that the current human mindset is not equipped to deal with our current technological age. Now what do I mean by this? We currently live in a society in which it is very easy to access people being very good at a specific individual field. You can always go on the internet and find some five-ear-old who can play piano better than you ever will, some 14-year-old who draws incredible art. And so at the beginning this makes it very demotivating for kids who live in our current society, in which they are based upon conventional measures. Instead, what parents should focus on is teaching kids to try and find ways in which they can create products, or create view points, which might be different from those of just hyper-talented people. In which they can bring their multi-faceted life experiences, their family experience, their geography and so on, to be able to create something that though may not be good on a technical level, is at least unique and able to speak to people in different ways.

And for people who are born without this, or people who might be born with physical deformities or that kind of thing, that can lead to bullying for them, and that is just absolutely wrong. And so what we can do is by teaching kids that each person is special and brings their own thing to the table, they don't need to have the conventional skill of physical ability or just intelligence in order to be able to be a valuable human being.

For instance, like women coming up and talking about how they are sexual assault survivors.

1205,"magnifier of these harms of these political policies
What are the harms? Threefold. Firstly, we think that this makes a loud minority deceive the majority into voting against their own interest. What government side has to support, in this case, is Trump and his fear-mongering strategy to get the majority of the population to vote against their own interest. It's things like emotionalized experiences of crime and violence that take the status of Mexican immigrants out of context and say, ""This is what they are doing."" And when people talk about personal experiences of having a crime done to them by a Mexican immigrant, that does not mean that that is a generalized truth in America in today's world, right? But it emotionally moves certain people who directly perceive this as a generalized situation. We think that this deceives the majority into voting for policies that are not right for them. Notice the bias here. Positive emotions are far less effective in the political sphere than negative emotions. At the point in which personal experiences directly focus on negative aspects of certain immigrant populations or certain minorities, we think that this disproportionately harms them, to the exclusion of others. We think that it's very hard to compare different personal experiences. That's why voters can't make an objective account in this case. The second harm that comes from personal experiences in political debate is that this pushes politicians to the extremes. That's to say when emotions and personal experiences dominate political debate, every politician is forced to engage in that. Why? Firstly, just a large perception that this is somehow more powerful and persuasive to the public. But second, they want to avoid sounding really cold and calculating, at the point to which other politicians are talking about very personal stories, where you're talking about numbers. Why is it incredibly bad? Firstly, you lose the opportunity to genuinely inform the politics and what policies each candidate stands for. Notice that publicized and televised political debates or other unique opportunities to actually inform the public on political issues and get them to be informed voters when they actually do elections. You lose this opportunity at the point in which you focus more on personal accounts and subjectivity, rather than actual facts and what policies each candidate stands for.",constructive1,,andrewyun7,round3,andrewyun7_round3,0.0,76.0

Therefore, you get a disproportionate sway to one side of policies that get talked about.",constructive2,,andrewyun7,round3,andrewyun7_round3,0.0,76.0
1207,"The last thing I want to say under this argument is that politicians are less likely to translate their promises into policy at the point in which political debate focuses more on personal accounts. Why is this so? Firstly, you focus more on the problem, rather than actionable solutions, at the point in which personal experiences largely serve to identify what the problem is in society. But secondly, you get less tied down by campaign promises, at the point in which publicized debates are focused less on making campaign promises and promising to the public, rather than just focusing on personal accounts and subjective issues that serve to try to move the public emotionally. Secondly, I'm going to talk about how this harms social groups that are involved. Firstly, I think you prompt the opposition parties to attack your experiences directly, rather than the policies that you stand for. There is a difference between attacking objective political preferences that you have and attacking painful experiences that are very integral to who you are. If you're a woman in the workforce who suffered from workplace discrimination or an immigrant who is refused service because of your race and your opposition party in these political debates say that your experiences are illegitimate or not what is largely true about the world, we think that that harms you personally. But secondly, an impact of that is you socially divide the populace even more, at the point in which the experiences that you as a member of a particular social group are more likely to have become politicized in and of themselves. Your party allegiance is directly tied to who you are and your identity, and that's more likely to segregate the voting population into different social groups who think that's terrible for the political atmosphere in the long term.",constructive3,,andrewyun7,round3,andrewyun7_round3,0.0,76.0

Firstly, you have to find people who are actually willing to sit in these committees without any monetary compensation. So, the people who often have to sit through these committees, they have to relive the trauma when they look through facts or testimonies. So, given that the people they're likely to identify... to hire onto these committees are people who are not sympathetic to the losers of that conflict because they don't mind looking at these facts. They don't mind going through that trauma because it doesn't personally affect them at all. But why is this especially bad? Because this means that they're less likely to give sympathetic sentences to people who are actually a detrimentally affected through this conflict. I'm going to explain this later. But secondly, it's hard to find people who are knowledgeable enough to actually sit on those committees for two reasons. Firstly, especially in post-conflict societies, those with knowledge about the legal system are the first ones who are killed because they don't want resistance from them. But secondly, you have to persuade the constituent base that you can actually give out legitimate sentences. What does this mean? Firstly that you have to draw out long-term processes within the investigative committees as well. Especially because you're only looking for things like objective facts which we would say are harder to find than subjective testimonies from the people and also that you don't have enough resources now that are going to be given to the courts.

Results of these investigative communities come out where we started, we're going to say are still going to be biased. But the second part, this is especially, important because foreign diplomats are not going to be able to come into society to make any judgements. Foreign people who have more expertise in terms of core issues are not going to be let in because people want legitimacy and legitimacy comes from people who they think understand the issue better. They're not just going to let some foreign people come in and make decisions for them. The last reason why it's hard to get enough sway is that you have to find people who are not biased, but who stayed as States themselves having the sense to promote like-minded individuals into this committee. Why? For three reasons. Firstly, they want to retain their own power. This is pretty much analysis that's given to us by inside government. This, instead of analysis. And when we say that the reason why they want to have people who are likely to retain their own powers because one, they don't want the committee digging up their own stuff, their own problems that they commit in the past. But secondly, silencing that they talk about applies to these committees for exactly the same reason. But secondly, they do this because they want to curry favor in the long-term. That's how politics works. They appoint people who are like-minded and expect for them to do a favor for them in the long-term. But lastly, they can use it as a reward system to garner support in the first place when they're supporting this rebel cause. But the second part is, that it's the impact of this argument is that it's actually hard to preserve the sanctity of the judicial system and our world in which you use these kinds of committees for two reasons. Firstly, there's a lack of persecution simply from the fact that these people are less experienced than the Judicial grads who has more experience with this. But secondly, it's hard to have a stable functioning society at the end because you're unable to reach these unbiased conclusions. ",constructive2,4.0,dfang8,round7,dfang8_round7,0.0,

They have testimony like these investigative communities on their side and we have courts. And why are courts better, even if they're in the same branch as the Executive branch? For three reasons. Firstly, they have this thorough process that they follow through, so he can't forcibly hasten it just because you want some political means or achievement at the end. But secondly, you can't just randomly change your loss to benefit a certain party even after the takeover because the court is still bound to some extent by the public at the very end of the day. And the government has just simply failed to analyze the instances in which the rebels have Seat and the party of the court doesn't align with the party of the majority. But thirdly, we tell you that these committees are likely investigate political issues first, instead of ones the actually matter, things like human rights. And lastly, the government is still going to put money into these courts to establish legitimacy unlike these temporary committees. The second extension is on why we get more systematic troubles on their side of the house. Three reasons. Firstly, the government now has an excuse to not reform courts and not reform internal issues. They can just push their burden away. But secondly, the public chaos means that you have a decrease of legitimacy in the government in the short-term. So the committee has to give out fast sentences. But we explain firstly, why this is not going to happen. But secondly, if it does happen, it's going to be biased and ineffective. The last reason is that, you as the government, then don't have enough political capital after establishing these kinds of permanent temporary committees. Because one, because you have to prove the legitimacy of that. The impact of this is twofold. First, it's hard for you as a state to move forward with other progressive issues in the future.

You can be successful in school, you can be successful at sports, you can be successful at debate, but what does it mean to be really successful at listening, being very special in terms of listening, being very special at organization, being very special at these things? That is something that is not seen as actually special in the status quo. We think that on our side of the house, we say that the skills you have are special, and are going to lead you to success. That means that the skills don't necessarily have to be having a high IQ. The skills can be being a very good listener, being very empathetic. We believe that you can view that as special, and be successful in that way. That means that we no longer have cookie cutter cutouts of what it means to be a successful person. You don't just be like, ""Oh, a successful person has all these qualities."" No, everyone is special, and everyone is successful in their own ways, and it doesn't fall into the really binary way we define success today.

In particularly homogeneous minority areas in urban areas, public education is very poor due to the fact that these areas are labeled rough neighborhoods because of increased police presence due to the racial homogeneous of the area. And therefore good teachers are less likely to infiltrate or are less likely to want to teach in these areas.

Everyone is told that the only value that they have comes from production, and no one is made to feel special, especially not the children. And the reason why it is manifold, children don't have any real agency. So in a productive capitalist society, they have no inherent value. That is the rhetoric of the status quo, is you only have value in so far that you produce. But this is inherently wrong for two reasons. One, it makes people feel less human. When you're told that you don't have value because you don't do something that is good for society, that shame, you feel inherently bad in that moment because you've been told that not only are you not possessing value, that society doesn't consider what you consider value true even. And then, the further extension of this is that this makes people treat others as having less value. Because if you don't think that you're special, how can you think that another human being is special? How can we say that someone else has intrinsic value within their life, if you can't even believe that about yourself? And that is what is especially important in this motion. And in the status quo, where this anomaly falls upon most, are children of marginalized communities. Because in many societies, especially societies that fall strictly on ingroup, outgroup lines, there is part of an internalization of society saying, ""You don't have worth"". This has been addressed sociologically for years when dealing with interdynamics between disparate communities in the United States.

And the reason why this burden does fall on the parents, is the role of the parent is to provide a good life for your child. I don't think anyone here is going to argue against that. But part of a good life is your quality of life. Being a parent isn't just about making sure your kid makes it to the next birthday. It's about making sure they enjoy their life and are settled for life, even after you're gone. Part of this good life that we want children to have, is valued in yourself. And that's what this house would do. When parents teach their children that they're special, they begin the process of learning about self-esteem and learn that you can actually value yourself not along someone else's metric, but along your own metric. What does this look like? As you gain self-esteem, which I think anyone who's done public speaking competition can tell you, it plays into your confidence. If you think you're a shit speaker, you're not going to be as confident going up to the microphone. But, and this doesn't... Obviously it doesn't just apply to politics. But, when you have self-esteem and you gain this confidence, it actually makes the way you interact with the world easier on you. If you're confident, if you're not racked with anxiety because you feel like you don't have value in a specific field, you're going to apply yourself more to that field. And you're going to have a more intense interaction in that field because you can let your guard down. You feel safe in what you're doing.

This bad decision making comes about because when your parents tell you that regardless of your abilities... when your parents tell you that you can do anything, you kind of internalize this idea, right? Which basically means that you can be Mark Zuckerberg number three and drop out of college and maybe have a new start-up. Something that you will actually believe because it's something that your parents pushed when you were one to five years or one to 10 years old, and it's something that's so deeply ingrained on you. This means that you're more likely to do things like take out risky loans to, for example, pay for your start-up, right? Which would lead to you being in gross amounts of debt, in the end, if that startup is not successful. Moreover, it would probably lead to you thinking that... not really engaging with the consequences of your risky behavior because you will continue to think you're special, which would mean that you would continue to participate in said risky behavior.

We argue that early childhood care creates a positive feedback loop because children who have early childhood care, have the greatest ability to engage in... Have the greatest ability to learn material later down the line because of increased care and attention that they're given as children. We think that these strong resources that they've been given early and they're carried through to later parts of your life, which results in increased preparation for college and increased success when they're in college. A couple subpoints to this argument. So first... So our Subpoint A is that we can add readiness, we can have readiness after early childhood care is incredibly important, not just when students enter college, but also leading up to college. So throughout the entire primary and secondary education system, we also think that the educational benefits that they gained in early childhood education accrued through those years as well. So we think that early childhood education affects all 12 plus years of education. Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student. Which means that aren't super expensive per student compared the price of early childhood education.

Because the price of community college slightly increases students will also have the greater ability to financially plan or more financial literacy in general if they have access options like early childhood. So now our second independent argument is that we think that our model closes educational inequities. So we think that in educational inequity, speaking at an early age for example, studies show that differences in vocabulary with standardized testing abilities start as early as early childhood care and that differences in early childhood care or the amount of time that gets spent as ages lead to differences later down the line.",constructive1,,meganwu,round2,meganwu_round2,0.0,76.0

For example, they are hopefully self-sufficient adults, maybe not, I don't know, but hopefully college students are more self-sufficient than a toddler who requires attention at all times. Moreover, the parents who call hopefully don't have to do that much to support their students, but the parents of toddlers or young infants have a ton of burdens to fall on them. For example, they have to have the burden of starting a career, raising a child, and possibly taking care of their own parents and that ways, which means that support for a parents accrues exponentially in the longterm as well.

Even if they are not explicitly told this they are going to develop these things anyways. So given that this kind of imbalance, we need to equalize the playing field. The ability for women to understand their own self-worth is incredibly crucial because increasing the ability of women to advocate for themselves in situations of things like sexual violence, abusive relationships, or even in the workplace which I'm going to get into with our other kinds of gender minorities, with people of color, stuff like that as well.

Even if they don't feel like that, and in fact they do feel like they deserve more, they feel like their self-worth doesn't really matter because the people who are oppressing them are not going to give them access to these things anyways, right? So what happens now is that, given that rich white men, for example, are going to get their special entitlement anyways by virtue of being born with more wealth and power and privilege, they expect these kinds of gender minorities, like women, LGBTQ+ people, people of color do back down in situations in which there is asymmetry of power What does this look like? When you're in a situation when a person already believes that they are worth and deserving of things while the other doesn't, the person who doesn't necessarily is going to be less likely to fight harder or to advocate harder to get things like the promotion that they deserve or the wage rates that they deserve, right? We think this already manifests inside of the workplace, even if there is legislation that gives women agency to win these kind of fights, they are less likely to pursue these kinds of things because they feel like that this kind of gender imbalance necessitates to them that they back down and stay in their place. We think that by equalizing this conception of self-worth up to what men already feel like they have, we think that these people are going to necessarily have more agency to advocate for themselves and advocate for themselves in institutions of power like the workplace and such because of the fact that their conception of self-worth is shifted.",constructive3,5.0,sirtylerli,round6,sirtylerli_round6,0.0,74.0

As I opened up my speech, I think that when we talk about policy, we have to acknowledge the fact that different groups are affected very differently, where the policies are actually put into place. This includes different genders, sexualities and races, et cetera, and also different socioeconomic classes. A policy, it's not like a one size fits all thing. Different people are affected differently just by their circumstances, right? I think that when this happens, when you try to have this objective ideal, you tend to lose a lot of people coming in speaking about this policy and their effects on it. They tend to rely on these ideas of statistics, right? They tend to rely on this idea of physical... These more tangible ideas rather than the actual emotional experiences of people, I think a good way of actually seeing this is the way in which like women are treated in terms of the work place. When people see like a general trends, women who were in workplace having more leadership roles, they tend to overlook this emotional experience of women being harassed and still having this terror of bad experiences within the workplace just because they have this objective trend that, ""Oh, it's better than it was before. Look at these statistics."" I think that when we discount this emotional experience, we tend to lose a lot of that and that actually distances people from the effects of the policy. I think that when you have this happen, we tend to see that the people that are being affected most by the policy that had the most emotional reaction to them are seen as less logical and their experiences are discounted. We think that this is an inherent pawn that needs to be dodged of inside opposition's house.

I see that people have different experiences than me, but I think that when they talk about being objective, they're inherently biased because of their perspective and they tend to lose sight of the other experiences that are available, especially emotional experiences from groups that aren't necessarily there. I think that a good example of this is the abortion debate. I think that both sides both have their only objective. They both believe their sides are the objective truth, and they tend to ignore that the other side's issues as being like more emotional or less based on fact. Not right now. But they're...

Because the front half talks about a lot about privilege and I think we agree on the metric that these children need to be able to have some sort of way of self fulfillment if they're going to be disadvantaged in the first place. If a parent, it's actually a strategy of parents who are foster parents and parents who have adopted children to tell their children, look, we actually picked you, you're special. We know that your parents might not have kept you, but we care about you, and that's the reason why you're here. And that's incredibly important for the emotional aspect of a child, especially when they're in a very formative period of their lives and trying to find some sort of meaning, something to claim to some sort of identity to belong with. Even if we don't fully define what kind of special means for different children. We think that children are willing to and more able to explore the different kinds of passions they have when they know that they're special, and they know that they're capable of achieving something, but furthermore, it's something that children can claim to, like we told you because if they have a passion, even if it's in astronauts or robotics, that's something that can possibly lead to them cementing longterm passions in their lives. At least to better treatment of other children. It also means they're likely to reach higher. Look, disadvantaged children are going to be disadvantaged when it comes to money on either side of the house. The difference is how they perceive themselves and how they perceive themselves going forward in their world when they, their future is a large question mark. We would rather not tell them look, you're going to be structurally disadvantaged and therefore you're less likely to succeed on the balance of probability. We'd rather tell them that they're special, that they have potential, and it's on that basis that I'm so proud to",constructive1,4.0,vivianz101055,round6,vivianz101055_round6,0.0,75.0

Actually I forgot what that point was, so let's move on to some constructive, right? We think a couple of things on how children internalize messages and how that then translates to tangible changes. First, on how they internalize. We think that parents are the first exposure a child has to the way the world works. So it's a very important for parents is... Parents to positively reinforce their child. We believe that you don't get any learning about the world and it's more relevant to you for a longer amount of time then the interactions you have with your parent.

So it's probably the case that I want my mother who is giving me physical care to also give me emotional care and to get me care in the sense that I can be whoever I want to be. But thirdly, we think children's generally are impressionable and since they spend the most time with their parents, they are going to be most impressive with what their parents think. And then on that point, we think a couple of things on how this actually manifests to change. Remember the link that... Or the link chain that Argent gives you, you internalize the message, you discover some sense of purpose down the line, and you have a trying for success. We think it is probably the case that not everybody's going to achieve every goal they've ever been told by their parent, right. But what is the actual impact of this? We believe children are more encouraged to try for the things that they would not have tried for absent the message that they could actually try and access the leavers of change. So what does that do? It's for somebody who was in a low-income situation being told they are smart. It's like applying for a scholarship to get into a gifted and talented school that takes them out of that resource-poor neighborhood. What does that look like for somebody who was artsy but doesn't have the capital to access art?

1760,"We just think that it manifests in different ways that are nontraditional, right? We believe that self actualization is important for a couple of reasons. Argent gives them to you. I'll run them through you quickly. The first is that people, when they internalize this message, are even more likely to try for success. We just have numerically more people who will be successful in whatever that field is. So it's not the case that we believe all children might become the President of the United States, but, specifically for minority children, we believe children who were told that... were being verbally reinforce that they deserve the basic standard of what everybody has as a society who would not have gotten that message regardless are now internalizing the fact that they deserve basic necessities and basic rights are more likely to fight for those. What are the tangible impacts of that? We believe even if you get very few success, those people can step into positions of power and change things for the children behind them. So, that is to say you have people like Barack Obama who was told he was special from a young age. They're encouraging me to actually run for president because I see somebody who has been reinforced and this message trickles down. But secondly, we believe you have better community building. So it's the same when you have people like little miss Flint who internalize the message that what they're doing is important. It can lead to better outcomes for communities and specifically those who are communities at risk. But even if that is you take off minority children, what happens to the rest of the world, right?

1354,"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?",constructive1,,pmanisca,round2,pmanisca_round2,1.0,78.0
1355,"Yes, it is true that most of these pressures are from norms. But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

We also think that kids necessarily look up to their parents who they see them as role models and things like that. We think therefore it's really important for parents to what's given to their kids.I think you'll see something like... The examples of some of these kids are really, take a long time to show that their parents are abusive. As they look up to their parents so much. We think it's really important and matters what sort of message parents are telling their kids and what sort of aspect of socialization is going on. And we think with this sense of optimism that parents are able to instill in their kids, kids feel like they can overcome barriers. Right? Do you think that a parent for instance would tell a child that racism exists? But can tell them that they can overcome it.

We think this is especially true for minorities or low income kids who often might lack the confidence or feel the effects of the stereotype effects and other psychological biases that can keep them from succeeding when it really matters.

We think in the longterm that's all something that instead of kids, I'm turning more pessimistic looking down when they're able to see the long sort of arc of justice and are able to fight for what they believe in really important circumstances. We think this manifests itself and you're able to see this through like psychological studies that show the value of positive illusions and this sense of control we can get ultimately leads to longterm happiness for kids because they feel that they have control over their lives. Because they have this optimistic or positive messaging. But they also feel that if something goes wrong they're able to accept it. I'll talk about this more a bit later.

We think that these are probably going to exist in either world. But we think when parents are able to give their kids extensively positive and confidence messaging, and tell their kids they're special, the kids feel that they are able to like defeat or confront these negative stereotypes. I think this manifests itself when you see lower rates of things like mental illness or kids harming themselves and things like that.

But we think is most important is being able to confront that failure or being able to go in front of that bad moment and learn from it and do something else.

We think if kids don't see themselves as special and just see themselves that I am formed this way, there's nothing I could do to change the way I am, they're never going to have any incentive to try to change a character.

So we think we give them a unique incentive to push forward and try to fight those barriers.

Because they believe that they have inherent self weapon are less likely to see themselves get paid up. Now let's quickly look at the counterfactual.

The counterfactual rate is just in the absence of confidence. We think that all of that things you get in society now still exist. You get things like bullying, you got things like racism, structural barriers. You also get mixed messages from society about what is good. And you have no way to fight back against them. Oftentimes when you try to get positive messages in high school or later, it's too late. These children are foreman and there is still plas...

And as such, we're going to get huge waves of individuals who are private owners selling their property, decreasing the prices of property, and as such, that's the perfect opportunity for these actors, these mega developers, to buy a large swath of property. This is the fundamental reason why they're more likely get monopolistic situations where they control the entire rental market that people are now dependent on. We think it's more coercive than middle-class landlords because they own so much property and you don't have the fluidity of moving to a different landlord who might be potentially better because there's this corporation that owns a large amount of land in this area or neighborhood, and as such, it's very easy to collude and to raise rental prices. We rather have the middle class get this money from the rent, then mega developers. But furthermore, something unique about renters means that they have no control because landlords can suddenly increase prices. Landlords can ignore when you need like your home fixed or something like that. If there's a pipe broken in your home, they can simply ignore that situation. They can cause renovations because renters are inherently very sticky. What do we mean by this? It means that it takes time for them to move from one area to another. There's a huge opportunity cost of getting a new truck to move all of your furniture, changing, your address, changing everything that your postal code has been associated with in the past and also moving your children from one neighborhood to another. This means that renters are likely to be more coerced and homeowners because they don't have control over what happens and their demand for that piece of property is hugely inelastic. So that means that landlords have a lot of control over where these people are going to live.",constructive1,4.0,vivianz101055,round1,vivianz101055_round1,1.0,78.0

There are three reasons why it increases wealth inequality. First, it increases wealth inequality between people. So taxes affect people on the margins most. I'll give you a clear example. If a wealthy person owns a mansion, they also probably can pay for whatever tax is going to be. They have a large amount of wealth, and they're not spending it all on the mansion. They're spending a small fraction of their total wealth on this mansion that's why they feel inclined to buy it. A person of middle income who owns a small house, they probably spent a vast more portion of their income, and a vast greater proportion of their savings trying to purchase this house, which means they have less money left over to pay that tax.

They use this to take out loans in their name and use their home as collateral. They do this for various reasons. For example, if they fall into medical or student debt or they want to open a small business.

Now next, let's talk about marginalized kids. So if a child is marginalized, it's just an inconvenient, sad, unfortunate truth that they will have to work harder than anyone else to succeed and will face huge obstacles, not just to become a successful superstar, but just to pull their way into the middle class where they can live a dignified life. Where they can have enough food, things like that. So they need to be conscious of the need to work hard to succeed. If they're given the impression that they have natural good luck, that they have natural talent that will make them less likely to put in that effort, that will make them less likely to go above and beyond and do more work than their classmates and partners do, we think that's going to make them more likely to fail. So now, if you have average kids who are completely middle class who have enough food on the table, have a comfortable life, and are capable of happiness, but at the same time have some disadvantages, some drawbacks, we still think there are many universal things that apply to rich kids, poor kids, and to them.

They want their kids to be good at something cause they always wanted to be in the football state championship and never work. Their parents might literally just be wrong cause they don't have as complete information with that child as they do. We should let children grow up and decide what they want to be good at and what they want to tie their identity to on their own. We don't think that this is impossible.

So note that, then, I think what you end up is being able to see ... you're no longer looking at, as a parent, the calculus being that the ability for your kid to get into post-secondary school is dependent on the whims of the market and your job status as a parent at the point where they graduate, right?

The first thing to know is Russia wants a stable Assad regime and they don't want excessive conflict in the region, particularly in terms of their allies because they want to consolidate power to an extent that oil markets are especially favorable to them and the allies and the region and they feel like they're a stable presence to be dealt with. But secondly on characterizing the conflict, we think that rebels that are being supported by the Israeli military are already starting to dwindle. We think that the free Syrian army, which is largely supported by Israel, is starting to capitulate in many instances, especially of them conceding to the Assad regime and trying to make deals out of that that would allow them to escape that region without being harmed further in the conflict. We also see the US diminishing its involvement in the region, especially as Russia, since you've established better ties with them since the advent of the Trump regime who is actively trying to pull out troops from the middle East as we've seen, especially in the case of Iraq in support for that conflict steadily declining. Given that the US is the number one giver and provider of aid to Israel, I think it's extremely important to consider them as an actor. And in its totality, we see that Assad is actually maintaining control over the region in such way that despite Israeli attacks on certain key areas in Assad's regime and in Syria in general, there is wide support for what he's doing currently, especially when you consider outside foreign actors like Iran, which are supporting these rebel movements as well.

But this was quite counter intuitive to these narratives, especially when you consider the fact that Russia is aware that it might not be able to control what the Assad regime does and it might not be able to control what Iran does because they are in some ways independent actors that could act and attack Israel in a way that he might not be able to control if it's even more violent. So at that point, the escalation of conflict is even more likely. But let's talk about the US because the US is at a unique tipping point in this debate where they have to grapple with the Trump administration that is, either supporting Russia tacitly or overwhelmingly support Israel under threat. The latter is significantly more likely given the presence of Israeli lobbyists in Washington, which is enormous, given the fact that Netanyahu, and Putin, and Trump have very close ties and they're ideologically more similar than anything else that we've seen with past US administrations. And given the fact that Israel is often a very touchy subject for Americans where they want to be able to support them given their interests in the region. Russia's threat means you've embolden the American electorate, you embolden the Trump administration to come in and try to support them further, which means at that point that that escalation of conflict is significantly more likely. The impact is that you get destabilization in the middle east in terms of what your interests are, specifically with regards to oil markets, specifically with regards to people challenging the consolidation of power that Assad is doing by slowly ticking away at the rebel groups that are being supported by Israel. You're able to take on some of the bombings that happened against Syria. You are able to provide aid and alleviate those things.

Why is this? If you're renting a place, one, if you're renting your living room, all of a sudden, boom, that double the housing density because you have more people living in the same footprint increase housing density. Would also say that when you invest in a place with the intention of renting, you have more places in a smaller space so that you could have one set of utilities for the entire place you're renting.

Whereas in an urban area with millions of people, it's easy to replace someone if they move out. So it's a lot less risky for you as an investor. Why is this density necessarily a good thing? Three reasons, firstly, we said it's good for the environment because utilities are substantially less needed. You pay for heating to heat a space. So if more people in the same space and per person, less utility. We will say you're less needing to drive places, which means your environmental cost there goes down.",constructive2,,jacobsilcoff,round1,jacobsilcoff_round1,1.0,79.0

We say that there are societal benefits because when you're renting to people and you're literally your own house, you're a lot more likely to be mixed with different social classes. When you're riding public transit, you might be likely to see people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. You care about their issues because they're literally your neighbors and to reduce instrumentation on the basis of rich people that own their houses are now more likely to rent them to people that are probably poor off.

When you invest in a house, you can't just move if you need to get a new job somewhere else without going through the hassle of selling your house, especially if you have a mortgage, it can be incredibly difficult to do. So it sort of ties people down to a specific spot. We've seen, I think, it's actually for someone that has an unstable job situation, it's much easier because you can get up and move if you need to, you're not tied down to a specific place. If you have a lower income and then get a higher one, it's easier for you to move into a better place.

Even in today's climate where we can all agree that in the status quo objective debate is prioritized, we can still see that it's written with emotion and, if anything, if that increases, we're going to see less productivity, because right now that those facts are contextualized with emotions as far as it's productive.",constructive1,,kalyrama,round3,kalyrama_round3,1.0,80.0

Like, why is this kid mean to me? Or why is there this inherent inequality between the treatment of me and another student within the class? Whether it be because of wealth or because of race, I think that, ""Oh, you're just special. Oh you're just different,"" inherently loses some of that nuance when you're talking about these issues and it actually fails to confront this.

1331,"So what is the substance of we're going to bring? The first idea here is that post-secondary education is a more affirmative period than it is in like the zero to five year old. Three reasons here, gave them perfectly. The first is socially, you learn how to function as a person in society. So that is to say we believe that it's important what happens in those first five years because we believe what's even more important is how you live the 20 years, the 80 years you have on this planet, so that is how you're going to weigh this round. We believe you learn how to function in society, and learn how to function for the people around you, but you have the access you had to go to post-secondary education to say, if I never learned how to, I don't know, how democracy works or how capitalism works, I'm just going to be screwed as an adult has to exist inside those systems. Secondly, we believe, economically, you learn the skills and the trades you need to be a producer in a system that only values people for their production. But thirdly, we believe you self-actualize, so how you feel about yourself can be checked back against the ills of your childhood. So that as I say, even if you had a terrible childhood, what you learn in your post-secondary system can check back against a terrible childhood you had.",constructive1,,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate_round2,1.0,77.0
1332,"So how do we solve back a lot of these inequalities? I think mischaracterizes the idea about inequality here. The problem now is that a lot of these early childhood periods do not have a regulatory body to check that for any inequality. So it's not the case that the state is doing a bad job. It's a case that the state's not doing a good enough job regulating the differences in early childhood development. Why is investing more money not going to solve this? For a couple of reasons. One, we believe the rich will always have more access to the levers of power to get better for their shoulder, no matter how much money you've probably spent in the system to equalize it. We believe the rich have better networks of access, no matter how much you give to lower income people. The families of the rich will always have the best nannies, the best healthcare services, the best, et cetera. But third, even when people get access to basic resources equally, there are still rich students get more of it because of the nature of capitalism, right? How do we solve back this educational inequality, these very foundational inequalities? The first is that the comparative is that there's no equality in a childcare system, no matter how much public funding goes towards it. But the second is that you get targeted spending across systems that are already meant to be more equal. So that's say you get more spending in the public education sector, you get more spending in trade schools, get more spending in... you get more spending in private health, private education systems. But the purpose of higher education is to solve back inequalities. I'll take it from that.",constructive2,,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate_round2,1.0,77.0
1333,"So let's just say I'm a child, and I didn't get the best health care, I can go to a college, and learn these systems. I can go to a college and become a more social, more economic agent, and I can begin to correct for the ills of my childhood. We believe what happens in the first five years is important, yes. But what happens in the next 60 years you are alive on this planet can solve back a lot of those harms. ",constructive2,,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate_round2,1.0,77.0
1334,"So why is secondary spending so much more needed? Remember that in the absence of motion, children still get taught and still get access to the basic skills you need to be alive. If that didn't happen, you would have massive childhood mortality. That is not the status quo, I'm not going to convince you otherwise. So why should your funding go to post-secondary education? I just told you the most important economic impact of this round is the student loan prices, but I leave the motion, but this one is going to go a little bit differently, right? We believe that the most important thing in this ground, then, is going to be what happens in the timeframe of a person's life when they progress out of their childhood years, and are no longer under the guise of their parents and they become individual agents. We believe leaving children high and dry in their post-secondary education is doing a massive injustice to people around us and the people of our society.",constructive1,,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate_round2,1.0,77.0
1474,"vastly outweighs it, but also note that in the status quo, and this is where we think we take down a lot of Bobo. Christians and the majority groups are already supported or catered to, because the state already has an incentive to get that vote because if they are the majority, it is already beneficial for them to pander to them and make sure that rights don't get violated or whatever. So what does this mean? Right? I think this means that this discrimination they talk about is already dealt with in status quo and the States would never fight this battle because they also rely on the majority of the Christian populace. So they would definitely concede to whatever demands are being done without having their economics like support being stripped away. So we don't think that's really in the clash of this debate. What do we then think this is about? And I think then it becomes about groups that are currently marginalized. I often ethnic, I've no religious groups specifically in the developing world who are often denied rights based on histories of that region or characteristics that go beyond the religion and I think that what this does that has set the stage to once it's clear that the federal government will not interfere in the issues of the state and now becomes easy for the state to continue to implement other discriminatory factors beyond just like limiting their rights. Religion. I literally doing what China's and rounding up these people in concentration camps and deciding to like literally start committing genocide, but then at the point of which there are, they know that there's no retaliation coming from the state. They also wants to cater to this majority. If you're not going to cut off funding, there's no existential threat then the primary existential threat that the state can paint is the ethnic minority, right? Like you can say, you know the biggest problem is that this, like minority is here to implement Sharia law change our country. When that is the existential, I'm not the fact that we're going to lose your job and be an economic disarray. That becomes a primary concern. You need transformation.

There's excess of demand and not enough supply. We think this has to many effects, right? It's the costs are too high and a lot of these renting areas and not at the time and like we have insufficient supply and people are left out and don't get housing. We think that naturally if you reduce housing purchases for these people in that liminal area between the working class and the middle class, that means that they're forced to like be subjected to renting, right? Which already is subject to huge problems. We think that then, what you're just doing is increasing the demand for rent that is already too high, which is going to raise prices further, which is going to mean that their further locked out of the supply to do what we have is actually less people in poverty who are able to have access to this housing.",constructive1,,nmcdowe,round1,nmcdowe_round1,1.0,79.0

Because when you have rent control, that means that it's not as lucrative to enter the industry. Right?

Secondly, what happens when funding is actually cut? Firstly, why is it still worse for all actors involved? Recognize that the popular will underlying this issue does not simply go away. It simply masks it at the point in which what is quantified as legislator is just not allowed anymore, it's just prohibited. We think that there are three main harms that you should care about. Firstly, it is worse for the religious population within that province or state because they now become a target of resentment within that province or state. Politicians have an incentive to shift the blame on these people for forcing their obedience to the federal government because they don't want to seem incompetent. They don't want to seem like their political agenda was compromised by the federal state.",constructive1,,andrewyun7,round5,andrewyun7_round5,1.0,82.0

Whether you are a Quebecer or not it is a very nationalistic issue and even people who weren't that tied to the religious aspect of this debate, of this controversy, now it becomes tied to who I am and what defines me as a Quebecer, which is you know, much more of an issue that is likely to divide the population and turn them against the religious minority in these provinces and States.",constructive2,,andrewyun7,round5,andrewyun7_round5,1.0,82.0
37,"The second part I want to talk about is how we use ability to moderate that state or province in the future and in the indefinite future. Why? Because we give the perception that the federal government is against them, that they are under threat, which is by the way already some pretense that has already happened in the status quo at the point in which the Quebec provincial government is currently constantly saying, ""We are under threat with the English majority. We have to assert our wills and our political voice out there for us to survive and achieve all the benefits that we want to have."" How we solve these perceptions is through continued social and political integration on both the federal level and on the individual level within these countries.",constructive3,,andrewyun7,round5,andrewyun7_round5,1.0,82.0
38,"The third harm under this constructive argument is that you stop cooperation in all other respects other than these religious issues, things like healthcare provision or welfare provisions, which are extremely controversial issues already.

And we think that this isn't the realm of possibilities because it's highly politicized and a very nationalistic issue and the politicians in power risk looking weak to the federal government. We think that at the point in which they leave the country, that's to say Quebec or some other powerful state in the U.S. for example, leave that country and say ""we're not going to be part of your Federation anymore"", and we think that this is a very big harm, not a very likely one, but still in the realm of possibilities that exist in this debate, we think that this is terrible for the country as a whole, at the point in which your economic prosperity for every single citizen in your country is lured to an extent where you're stronger when you're together and you're weaker when you're separated.

Insofar as if you have one religious group of being discriminated against at one time, you actually don't know what the discrimination is going to be 10, 20 years from now, insofar as government coalitions shift, individual prejudices shift.

1124,"Second thing we want to talk about is why the mechanism is uniquely good, why it's likely to be effective. So first of all, as I think op is going to agree to, this is a gigantic sum of funds. It's very unlikely that States are going to go against this insofar as their entire state economies in many instances are based in federal subsidies. Think about Iowa in terms of their other farm subsidies. We literally don't have the economy if the government, if the federal government doesn't intervene.

1125,"Number one is that it's impartial in a way state governments are not. So there's no particular ties to a certain ethnic group most of the time because they're heterogeneous across the entirety of the country. This especially matters in places with hot ethnic tensions and regional conflicts, so a country like Mexico for example, where there's a lot of state tension. It's very important that in Mexico specifically there is an individual regional government making decisions about ethnic and religious liberty and rather as the federal government which is agglomerated across all of these interests, they're a lot more likely to be protected in the general case.",constructive4,,prestonj,round5,prestonj_round5,1.0,80.0
1126,"Second, is that federal governments are directly bound to constitutions in a way that state governments are not. These constitutions, in most instances explicitly instantiate the right to religious liberty, but many state constitutions are not binding in the same way, or governments can just ignore them with more impunity. It's very important that we adhere to the federal constitution and liberal democracies, which protect religious liberties. But third, we'd say courts aren't as effective, so alternate mechanisms of enforcement aren't as effective. First of all, there's massive resource constraints, there's a huge time delay, regional problems insofar as court systems differ across States, so it's not clear that you actually establish a longterm precedent. We can also say that these mechanisms are also probably downstream of our policies so courts are more likely to be protective of religious liberty if that's the overall government policy.",constructive5,,prestonj,round5,prestonj_round5,1.0,80.0

So you just received less interpersonal discrimination because people ar-, because the state has not discriminated against you, you're less likely to be denied a job because you have a certain outward-facing religious characteristic. You can wear the clothing that you want to wear. You can participate in religious holidays without fear that the government is going to crack down on you because you don't adhere to a certain model of what they think religion is. We also think that there's a gigantic downstream norm effect from the federal government. Think about Obergefell in terms of the Supreme court in 2015, it's setting the precedent that gay marriage is legal.

Even if the quality of knowledge that gets offered inside opposition is better and more in post-secondary education, on that, we think that we make people more receptive to knowledge and it puts a knowledge in the first place on our side, which we think is a prerequisite for any benefit that they want to access.",constructive2,,andrewyun7,round2,andrewyun7_round2,1.0,80.0
277,"The third thing I want to say here is that early childhood care serves as an equalizer in society rather than the catalyst for disparity, which we think post-secondary education is. Notice, and the nuance here is important. Notice that financial factors hinder the poor population from accessing both in the status quo. That's to say early childhood care may be scarce or expensive for these people, but universities are also very exorbitantly expensive. But importantly, notice also here that there are plenty of nonfinancial barriers to universities, to accessing universities. Things like the neighborhood in which you live in. Things like admission standards, things like there's an opportunity cost to that that now uniquely exists, because now you're old enough to work and have a part time job instead of going to university, which don't exist when you're early in your childhood.",constructive3,,andrewyun7,round2,andrewyun7_round2,1.0,80.0

But second, you get better economic gains at the point in which the higher proportion of your population is literate and parents can all work and you will provide your economic potential to your country rather than taking care of your child because early childcare isn't provided in these countries. These are the most important impacts for developing countries specifically, who want to have a healthy population and an economy that develops, right?
