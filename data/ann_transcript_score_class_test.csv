By deemphasizing the importance of this, we're going to make sure that they're able to partake in safer financial practices and actually become educated before they take on the incredibly important responsibility of owning a home. What we also think happens is that because housing is, no thank you, is going to be taken over by these larger corporations that are much more incentivized to make sure that rent prices stay low. We told you two reasons why this is true. One, they're going to want to make sure that a lot of people come into their housings, so, they're going to want red prices to drop. This means there's going to be a lower trickle down effect than you would get from smaller landlords who are going to want to make sure that their punitive housing taxes are paid off by their renters.",constructive1,suryahendry,round1,78.0,8

But this means that landlords can push to the point where the renting is only marginally less expensive to housing, right? They can push the prices of rent to a point that it becomes difficult for these people to afford that, right? Because they only would be slightly cheaper than the alternative they create. This means that things get more expensive for anyone who wants to live somewhere. And that landlords also don't have a pressure to be good landlords, right? Because there are so like the market shifts in favor of the landlords because there are a lot of people who constrained to renting and this means that landlords don't need to try to keep people in their tendencies so they don't have to provide good services or include in the package for lease.",constructive1,miclew,round1,78.0,8

We also know this influences municipal governments to be able to make sure the price gouging won't happen. Instead of what's going to happen is because it is so good for cities to have these high density areas, to have all of these high rises, to have a thriving metropolis where people are able to flood into and work each day, as than having these enormous commutes and move outside of the city, we think that this is going to mean is that cities are really going to want these large corporations to make sure the prices stay low, to allow people to flood inwards.",constructive1,suryahendry,round1,78.0,8

They don't necessarily they don't engage in protests, they don't do anything to sort of push this agenda, right?

9,9,792,"Yes, it is true that most of these pressures are from norms. But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

It's the idea that when you have this big, flashy thing as opposed to economic incentives, we would tell you that economic incentives happen very slowly.

Yet people who are wealthy can evade taxes by putting their income into real estate, which ultimately again hurts lower income people. If you are putting that money that you make into investments, that is not money that's going to be taxed. So that is less money going to the overall population, the average Canadian citizen, if we're talking about Canada in this situation.

There's a lot of tensions between these people, but we don't know that if we're just looking at, ""Oh, they're policing this area more."" We need to get the actual story behind the figures. So what we see without this world where we bring subjective experience, we just see again numbers but this doesn't reflect the lived experience of people. At the end of the day, what we need to do is fill in the blanks with the gaps in our knowledge with the actual reality of the people who are living in these circumstances. What happens when you tend to bring in too much objective facts is it kind of glosses over a broad spectrum of people. We have to acknowledge that everyone is going to have a different experience and what happens with stats specifically and why I want to talk about stats, how they're not necessarily as effective is the stats tend to be, as we've seen, it's all about majority rules.

Why do you think that there are a million think tanks, thousands of really smart people paid really highly to consider what reality looks like and thousands of scientists try to determine what the pictures of reality look like? It's because determining what the status quo looks like, what reality looks like, is fundamentally something that's very difficult. It's something that is debated over and the whole reason of having that debate is because putting together that picture of what reality looks like is so incredibly difficult. The fundamental belief of trying to actually attempt to get to this idea of there is this fundamental picture is something that is incredibly hard. Note, that if is going to argue that stats exist, the thing is that stats are just numbers that need to be interpreted. And the way in which they are interpreted is through personal experience, is through live experience, is through contextualization, because the numbers themselves don't tell you anything. For example, dudes like Trump has a higher employment percentage than Obama and that's something told you by Republicans. There needs to be contextualization around why that number is. For example, like that number was rising during Obama's era and continued into Trump's.

So now our second independent argument is that we think that our model closes educational inequities.

32,32,736,"Okay, so now we're going to the meat of this on what is the harm to actually attempting to be objective? Because note that attempting to be objective and attempting to make a creative view in which you are objective means that you are trying and you convince yourself that you are succeeding, is actually creating a truth for yourself. Now that you believe that your view is probably the truth is probably correct that's what, for most people, what trying to be objective actually looks like. You don't realize that your own experiences, that the staff that you see, the facts that you see are still only your subjective view and you are viewing the window through a lens of your experiences still. We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right. And that was the narrative given by society that was propagated as the truth. That's the one you run into.

This is a world where you are actually better able to accept different viewpoints and actually have a more contextualization of the world in which you live in. It's a world in which people are better able to come to policies, ironically, because you are better able to come to terms with people's actual experiences. You are able to understand people's experiences more because you have no idea, no conception of trying to reach this truth because you understand that your experiences are only simply a subset of those that exist in society.

One, because they know that in a real way that's not abstract and distant from the problem, and we think that experience gives you a nuance and a complexity that you don't have otherwise. Secondly, we think you are going to think more rationally and extensively about issues that directly affect you. So just all other things being equal, a candidate like Warren is going to think about women's issues a lot more closely than Bernie is going to, because they're directly going to impact her life, and so we think that promotes more extensive thought. We think this is important with the debate around abortion. Women's voices should be the most important around abortion. Not every man should be able to get up and say their opinion on abortion is equally important, because it's not when it doesn't affect them and it doesn't have a direct impact on their lives. The same thing with cisgender people constantly speculating about the transgender community, who don't get their subjective experience at all.

Those experiences of the majority are inherently very widespread and well known. When we introduced this subjectivity as a valued element, we think that the subjective experiences which are under status quo, less well known will become more well known because they will be valued and which experiences are least well known are precisely those which are from the most marginalized communities.

Why is this? If you're renting a place, one, if you're renting your living room, all of a sudden, boom, that double the housing density because you have more people living in the same footprint increase housing density.

But secondly is the financing all things within using that currency, whether it's debt that they need to be using that currency for or whether it's going to be hurting international trade. All those reasons are why they care. The members of ACIAR grow to care about each other when they're tied together with a currency like the comparative is that China is much easier able to pick off countries like Vietnam, Cambodia because they put their individual interests over that of Southeast Asia. We tip that balance towards Southeast Asia rather than individual interests when they're having to go China because of the fact that they care about, they care more about the success in Southeast Asia. Another way in which we place a third way in which we increased the ties between Southeast Asian nations is that when you decrease the transactions costs of trade and we'll need to have more trade presents within ACIAR itself, that means you've increased the regional ties between each other. That means you're more likely to say my economy is now as a larger share of that did buy trade within ACIAR as opposed to China, are willing to vote interest of ACIAR. Honestly, this idea of how they say it, if they have conflicting interest, why would they ever go and balance each other, bail each other out? That's a problem that exists right now in the status quo. That's what we're trying to solve. The comparative on their side is they go to places like the IMF and China that are horrible actors to get their loans, their loans and then debt finance. I think the horrible thing is that now that we get to change for our side is that we have a currency that ties in together and that when those individual nations fail, every nation within that system, especially the rich nations like Singapore are going to shell out the cash to make sure that those nations are able to rebound and the currency is able to be stable.",constructive1,123dyly,round4,79.0,9

So, for example, church organizations, which are often quite political are concentrated in particular areas in the south, which means that if you have the states determinate, like not the federal state.

We think that the best way to uphold democracy is not by allowing the federal government to decide what states ought and... be allowed to do. Recognize that their thing is in violation of the democratic rights of those people in the state, because now you're pegging all federal funding to things that we have had a social contract with people in that state to provide for them. Things like health care, military defense, and education, to a very specific issues that you're choosing, as becoming the now most ultimate, important issues of democratic rights.",constructive1,kolyncheang,round5,84.0,14
132,134,57,"Okay, when do common currencies work? We think there are two major conditions here. First of all, we have to have a mobile population for economic interconnectedness to actually work. This looks like a couple of things. First of all it looks like people being able to actually go where the jobs are in order to reap the benefits of any sort of economic growth. This doesn't happen when it's literally a region composed of islands separated by massive bodies of water and also crazy inherent cultural differences. We already think it's pretty unlikely that Malaysia is going to get along really well with Vietnam or Thailand, so we think that we're to create any real interconnectedness when people can't travel between the two nations and have no reason to overcome the differences that already exist there.",constructive1,susieg,round4,84.0,14
133,135,760,"But first, I just want to acknowledge the fact that when this happens, we aren't secure on the side of pink government. Believe first this influences people from the actual policy being implemented and discounts experiences of it and secondly, you lose a lot of new laws on the issues which we think is inherently very dangerous outside the boxed world, right? I think that when we have these quarrels, in which you lose this personal experience, you lose... You create a disconnect and inherently create more polarization than what we currently see. So first thing on this idea of this distances, people from policy discounts, experiences. As I opened up my speech, I think that when we talk about policy, we have to acknowledge the fact that different groups are affected very differently, where the policies are actually put into place. This includes different genders, sexualities and races, et cetera, and also different socioeconomic classes. A policy, it's not like a one size fits all thing. Different people are affected differently just by their circumstances, right? I think that when this happens, when you try to have this objective ideal, you tend to lose a lot of people coming in speaking about this policy and their effects on it. They tend to rely on these ideas of statistics, right? They tend to rely on this idea of physical... These more tangible ideas rather than the actual emotional experiences of people, I think a good way of actually seeing this is the way in which like women are treated in terms of the work place. When people see like a general trends, women who were in workplace having more leadership roles, they tend to overlook this emotional experience of women being harassed and still having this terror of bad experiences within the workplace just because they have this objective trend that, ""Oh, it's better than it was before. Look at these statistics."" I think that when we discount this emotional experience, we tend to lose a lot of that and that actually distances people from the effects of the policy. I think that when you have this happen, we tend to see that the people that are being affected most by the policy that had the most emotional reaction to them are seen as less logical and their experiences are discounted. We think that this is an inherent pawn that needs to be dodged of inside opposition's house. Before I move onto my second point of losing nuance of issues, which is our main point now inside the government, anything from all. Okay, so that makes sense. I think losing the nuance of issues is the most important part of governance teams, right? I think that when we talk about that nuance of issues, we talk about people's experiences, we talk about people's inherent thing, but I think also what happens when you have a subject view.",constructive1,saveferris15,round3,74.0,4

These people have no recourse and they're stuck in a system where they aren't able to actually change their government and allow there to be this change. Furthermore, we talk a lot about this key of secular governments. This whole idea that religion should be a private matter, which we think is true. They are onside government artificially conflate the banning of religion with this idea of separation of church and state. When we've talked about things in private where we want people to be able to practice their only religions, but what we don't want them to do is have those beliefs interfere with the government's activities and interfere with the public sphere to extend where it is intrusive on other people.",constructive2,ksbrown,round5,74.0,4

We think that it's much more beneficial on our side of the house, but second of all, we think that the political mobility also has an impact because they, they tend to talk about the fact of most marginalized people, right?

So the motivation to work often has to do with the bond you have with your parents, like making them feel happy, right? When the parent says...

I think that when this happens with the objective ideal, you tend to have people shut down because of their emotional experiences. It's natural to have emotional experiences as a result of this, but also your personal experience is inherently tinged with emotion. I think that, when we talk about our personal experiences in your own interactions with policy, you would need to bring up your own experiences which brings up emotion, and you also are discounting the value... The validity of this personal experience as a role to that. I think when we talk about issues... When we talk about policy and different social issues, you need this nuance, you need this personal experience, and we can't just have this idea of being objective is the only right way because you end up losing so much, you tend to lose your idea, lose the ability to actually have a conversation of productive conversation where you can have your mind changed because you don't believe that they're... What they're saying... What the other side is saying is bad. I think also the huge problem is that this idea of losing the validity of your experience in your emotions, distances, the effects that policies have on people when you're actually talking about implementation and everything. I think that this inherently hurts a lot of different groups that are already at the edges of society. When you tend to try to discount their personal experiences because these are usually not the people that are thought about in the policymaking, just given the demographics made up of our governing body and these are the people that are most hurt by the subjective ideal.",constructive3,saveferris15,round3,74.0,4

153,155,767," So let's talk about global, well, this brings me into our second main contention. Beside the main contention is primary education is obligatory. Globally, sometimes this is a lot of places, the culture is this is the only education you're getting. This is something that's really critical. We must invest in the education that everyone is getting. If, let's just say 100%, 95% of the population gets primary education and past primary education, globally speaking, a small percentage of the world actually continues on that.
Let's just say I know, hypothetical. Let's say 50% of people do. But if you're investing in primary education, you are literally helping the most number of people because more people do primary education than anything else. So you're investing in the most amount of people, which is great. In a lot of countries, you go to primary education and then you go into work. These skills that you learned in primary education help you with, those are the ones that are critical to working. If you have specific skills you can learn them in job training and stuff like that. But, I have to say that these secondary education doesn't really have the big impact on how to communicate and how to cooperate with others. It's critical and getting into financial, because the whole thing, it's why would you vote for more finances? In the other countries for example, like Africa.
Students need uniforms to go to school, they need uniforms or they need books and sometimes those things are requirements. You need a uniform to go to school, but this is really hard on families with low income so this helps ease the burden and make sure that everyone gets to the same place, starts from the same place. I'll take you in 30 seconds. In these schools, if two kids have to share a book and if then you don't have textbooks for all the kids, then they're only going to be getting half the assets to these things. And that's critical because at these early ages, kids are still learning how to learn and if they have their own materials, they're going to be more excited to do that. And that means at home. When the kids go home after school and they're having their work with them. If they're able to afford the books to bring home and study, they're going to develop a love for that.

They would say you should sympathize as criminals and you shouldn't sympathize with minorities as much because they're more likely to commit crimes on our side. You should focus more on empathy and on the human emotions of individuals and have that be higher-weighed over top of political discourse and debate, the numbers of which can often be skewed and interpreted according to one's own biases or moral views. You see it... you saw it in the eighties in the nineties a lot of crime think-states that come out and push a lot of studies, a lot of data, as important, political think-tank censes to create objective ways to sort of filter their world view through a political debate. And what we see is that what these things are doing was creating studies and economic policies that were seen to be objective and scientific that instead of pushed sparkle policies like Progressive Tax Policy, ""freakoconomics"", ""stop and frisk""... All these harsh-on-crime, broken windows ideas that are in actuality very harmful to the emotions and the lived experience of individuals under this guise that is, instead, a very objective sense of policy, and that the facts are never wrong and that instead we should, that we should focus on these facts instead of the actual emotions and lived experiences of individuals... Because what's happening in politics, and the whole impact of politics in general, is going to impact not only human beings in, well let's say, economic wealth and everything, but also how they live their lives. And when we look at how people live their lives, it's heavily impacted by their mental state and their emotional system. So what's going to happen under the side of the status quo and this current narrative that we're writing, what's already happening is that people are losing their sense of humanity.
