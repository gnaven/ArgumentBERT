When you are taxing the personal home ownership specifically, we didn't get a model from the government, but we're going to assume...

So this does not just proportionally increase the impact on the wealthiest people, rather it actually disproportionately harms the poorest people, because they have the most percentage of their wealth invested in their homes. This is particularly true of very high hot housing markets like New York, Vancouver whatever, because in those places people have bought homes at when they were affordable as working class people, and now they're still own those homes even though prices have skyrocketed.",constructive1,,jamesashwell,round1,jamesashwell_round1,1.0,81.0

So as a result of this motion, we think that it's very intuitive that people are going to lead to be preferring to rent over the longterm. I think this is very intuitive, but when you're taxing something, it's becoming more expensive, the alternatives are not changing in their prices.

I think this is most important because, when you have a source of housing, it's from there that you can begin to pursue the rest of your fulfillment in life. It's necessary to have this stable source of housing in order to seek employment, in order to be invested in your community. When you're renting, you're always subject to eviction notices from the landlords who are always pickled, who are always going to be increasing the rent as market rates change.

1526,"see on TV. Do you think you're special because you have an iPhone 9? Wait until the next iPhone comes out, and the person who buys it is more special than you because their camera has three more pixels. The notion of specialness is one that is reinforced throughout society. It's one that you always have to adhere too and is an expectation that not everybody can achieve, but nobody can achieve. Because it inherently forces you to prove a negative. What is the harm of this? I think the harm of this is people can never properly appreciate their lives in the present. They never get a sense of mindfulness in which they evaluate the present as a good, but rather are always told to expect to compare that to some better possible future in which you get a one up on someone else and are therefore more special. I think this is also particularly important in the context of children, because I think children both biologically, culturally, geographically go through and wide variety of changing in life. You're different from the age of six to eight. A notion that is always forward looking means that children can't reflect on the wide variety of experiences they experience and will probably never experience again in the same way throughout their lives. So what is the... Given the harms of a hegemonic notion of specialness, what is the exceptional importance of an alternative analysis that parents provide that emphasizes, as opening opposition talked about, normalcy and your ability to be mindful and be happy with the present? No. Firstly, during childhood and teenage years. Given these pressures exist when children are young and formative, the ability for parents to provide an alternative analysis means there's a safe space for children in which children can do things like discuss their lives without expectations placed on them. The way... By the way, this rebuts everything Gov says. [Inaudible 00:05:22]. But, some people will be told they're special. The notion that you should be... The harm of someone being told special when some people aren't only occurs when there is an expectation that all people be special.

Assuming opening government's framework in response to my POI that these values translate into adulthood, not embracing specialness allows people to have multiple conceptions of themselves that can occur at different points. That is to say, I don't think people should or do live their lives with a universal notion of who they are or what they are. The important thing to note is that given all the pressure they have to feel special, the fact that they have a well grounded familial notion that their parents provide of an acceptance of normalcy and being in the present means that there are multiple philosophical and analytical conceptions that children who become adults can use. Because I... People switch between different ways of thinking about themselves. This provides a strong basis to provide an alternative to the otherwise external pressures people feel to always feel special. You don't get a promotion, fine. It's good being normal.

We think that the best way to uphold democracy is not by allowing the federal government to decide what states ought and... be allowed to do.

This means you devote an anxiety along the way because you are afraid of confirming it to yourself that you weren't the special person that you told you were. This means that you become anxious to perform the tasks necessary to even try to live a good life because to perform those tasks is accepting the fact that you might fail along the way and that you have to live up to the fictitious expectation of your own self, which, in many circumstances, can be a debilitating anxiety. For example, if you are trying to get into medical school, the process of failure isn't just not getting in. It is noticing that your grades are slipping, that you might not have done particularly well on the MCAT and noticing that you are cutting eerily close to failing.

The same thing for instance with Richard Wallenstein demonstrated how the federal government segregated United States. It is not a subjective claim. It is a fact and that is how you get more policy that is better on our side of the house. Another example of this for instance is disrupting rectified power structures. For instance, where you understand federal colonialism as a fixture, as a structure rather than as an event that happened. We only get that by excavating the histories and relying on objective facts. So, on our side of the house, what we want to emphasize is that there is no way to communicate between subjective claims on their side of the house.

If they do, then the Supreme Court would get involved and there are various adjudication enforcement measures in order to make sure that states, federal governments, local government, in both Canada and the United States, will go ahead and say, ""Well actually you can't do that, the power doesn't exist. So we remove you from office, we'll stop you from doing so or we will choose not to enforce this decision coming from your state coat.""

1540,"Moving now to my worlds analysis under my resolution analysis from two, we're talking about exactly the worlds that we're seeing here in the . So number one, we can go ahead and look at the opposition role. The opposition role is going to go by the main routes of adjudicating issues between the states and governments on civil liberty matters. So we're going to use the current system, the current way of dealing with these issues... We're going to adjudicate them. Here's a great example of exactly how it would happen the opposition in the world. A few years back after Obergefell was passed, there was this homophobic judge in Alabama and she essentially decided that she was not going to work according to Obergefell, when it became legal for people to get married to people of the same gender. So what she says, ""I'm not going to enforce this, I'm not going to officiate wagons."" She was removed from her position and the federal government stepped in and said, ""You can't actually do that because you don't have the power to do that because we've just decided that civil liberty under the first amendment."" So we can see here that adjudication is working in the current system and there are ways to do it without withholding funding, but I believe the government will like you to believe the only way we can have these sort of adjudications is by withholding funding from state governments to force politicians out of power to coerce them by making people really really mad at them for the things that they've done. But I'll have a couple points later on about why this idea is actually absolutely ridiculous and because politicians aren't just going to switch up overnight. Lately, the people that elected them to that place are going to stand by their original position which is removing the civil liberty from those people. So this is problematic in the government world no matter how you look at it, because withholding money from these people isn't going to make them change their mind on it.

1541,"""You don't have the power to do this because you're a state and you're violating the constitution."" So we'll go ahead and move down to talking about another context point and that is, what is federal funding? Where does federal funding go and who does it impact?  So number one: federal funding goes largely to schools, federal funding goes largely to roads, federal funding goes largely to emergency funds. It goes to hospitals, it goes to all of these various different things. We can see here is that you have two ways you can look at federal funding: either it doesn't matter and it's not going to sway the decision on the States or it does matter and it's going to harm people, if you actually remove the federal funding. I believe what the government team is going to say, ""We are going to harm people"", so they take the politicians out of office so they will tell our agenda. Now, I don't particularly like that. I do like civil liberties, but I don't like that idea and I think you're saying that we're going to harm the people to change the government. I don't think that's the way we can do it. I don't think that's the best way to do it and that's the government role you have for you, whereas you have with the opposition world, you can go through the basic means of adjudicating what we have today through the rule of law. So my first contention is basically talking about how this violates the basic precepts of both the founding of the United States and of Canada. This is a complete violation of how these governments were supposed to work. In the United States, we built a system where we have state governments, local governments, and the federal government and overall the federal government was supposed to have the constitution and then our negative liberties under there. We say, ""You can't violate these whether you're a local, state or federal government and you can't touch these things."" The Supreme Court decides where to and how to apply that law. Then decisions made by states will be adjudicated and said, ""No, you don't actually have the power to do that and we're going to stop you from doing that.""

Now let's say if there's absolutely no other place to go and the state government is not inclined with the federal government. There are needs and we've seen this in United States history and in the present which states had basically said, ""We aren't going to do what you want us to do."" That's called the Civil War. We got into the Civil War to stop them from violating liberties that the Supreme Court and that the federal government basically said, ""These are civil liberties and you are violating them.""

This is what comes out at the end of speech where he says that if you have a credible threat of people being angry and resorting to extra judicial means because their needs are not being met, that forces political systems to create institutions like courts that manage those conflicts in the long run. This is the most important issue in the route insofar as institutions resolve conflicts in the long run. So maybe emotional policies, let's take them at their best and say some emotional policies are created in the short run, but actually worse, they over-respond to subjective experience. But this is fine because in pluralistic societies we have a mechanism to negotiate those conflicts systematically between groups. So policies in the long run become more responsive because they're actually negotiating these conflicts. If you don't have a credible threat of anger, then elites are never incentivized to respond to the anger that exists in the majority, so these sort of angry things become prevalent in populous backlashes or extrajudicial means because they don't have a legitimate way of voicing their anger in the political system.",constructive1,,prestonj,round3,prestonj_round3,1.0,79.0

Note that this also deals with OO, who says that sometimes subjective policy is harmful. We would also say that we mitigated this with the dog whistle analysis with regards to the racism stuff, but elite-centric policies always means that you help fewer people If we help more people with majoritarian policies, then we're helping more people definitionally.

1212,"Okay, so on to themes. So first of all, what is objectivity? So, alt brings you the argument that objective experiences won't be valued. That subjective experiences won't be valued the same way. That you'll have small groups of people on one side who provide subjective experiences that won't be valued by the system that exists. What Niah tells you is that this objectivity doesn't exist, and in our side of the house, when we live in a world where subject subjectivity is valued, then we get a more... Where we systemically value subjective experiences, then political debates can be more diverse. They can be more truthful. They can be more real when we understand that everybody has subjective experiences that contribute to the truth. When we see one category of people as objective, when we see one category of one people who bring facts as objective, then we're harming the other people in the debate, who can tell other people that they are being subjective and thus less valued in the debate. That we can tell them that they're wrong because we are objective, when we are not. So next op tells you that objective truth is more important. In our world, objectivity is not what's valued in debate. In our world, subjectivity is valued in debate. And thus, we create a better world where everyone's experiences have the opportunity to be valued and cannot be masked under false objectivity. We see a world where subjectivity is actually valued and is not seen as something less than. We see emotional personal experiences of groups of people that are not seen as less than. Because under our current, under the status quo, objectivity, which is really just a collection of personal experiences of the people in power, is seen as more than because it can be labeled as objective",constructive1,,alexsteele32,round3,alexsteele32_round3,1.0,78.0

So, I think that what we see on our side of the house, is that when we have a system where that values subjectivity and we get more... The way we get more diversity in debates is because people who have the privilege to be objective, no longer have the only card to play in the debate. They can't undervalue people in the debate because they're being subjective, because they're affected by an experience. The subjective experience is therefore valued, and they can't just discount them because they're not being objective. We see that as a net good on our side of the house, because on our side of the house, we have the chance to value subjective experiences, which under the status quo are told as untrue, and are not valued because they're not objective. When the people who are telling them that they aren't objective have the power to be objective, because they're not actually affected by the outcome of the debates. Therefore, this is really problematical. When we see objectivity is not real, we see subjectivity is valued. Then we get a world where multiple opinions can exist at the same time and therefore we get better debates, we get better politics and then we get better emotions, better social good overall.

621,"women and POC, which we think are good illustrations of this concept about women being overly emotional, and are therefore deemed unfit for office. That their arguments are illegitimate, whether that's online, or in a news station, or in political debates. We think the stereotype of women being more emotional can cause us to perceive them as overly dramatic, sentimental, unstable, because it's not the ideal. Because we view it as a problem, and we think we see this with Warren and Kamala, who focus a lot on personal appeals and stories and are often dismissed for that reason: because they're not rational. Especially with someone like Elizabeth Warren, that she's just a populist trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that she's too emotional to be in this race. We think that racial minorities are more often sidelined from being viewed as angry and irrational. We think particularly people in the black community often have their arguments dismissed, because they're perceived as too angry. We think we saw this with the discourse around Black Lives Matter, which for the most part was not violent and when they ... But the whole movement was very quickly characterized as violent, because we think we're ready to penalize emotion as being something bad, and because of this narrative that says that that should not exist in our political discourse. We also think it's a white male construct, because people who have more to lose are always going to be more emotional. It is the luxury of the privileged to be able to talk about issues that don't personally affect them in a flat tone, in a neutral way, and be like, ""Oh, I can see both sides of it."" When your life is on the line, you can't see both sides. When your access to an abortion puts your autonomy at risk, you're going to be more angry about it. And so, we think what we do when we put emphasis on objectivity is we raise the voices of the privileged who can afford to be neutral, and we minimize the people whose real experiences are too intense, too painful, to just have this flat affect and not express their own subjective experiences when they talk about these issues.

Because we think gender and sexuality embrace all these things that are important to consider. One, because we should prioritize the voices of those who have experienced certain things, and are affected by those things. One, because they know that in a real way that's not abstract and distant from the problem, and we think that experience gives you a nuance and a complexity that you don't have otherwise. Secondly, we think you are going to think more rationally and extensively about issues that directly affect you. So just all other things being equal, a candidate like Warren is going to think about women's issues a lot more closely than Bernie is going to, because they're directly going to impact her life, and so we think that promotes more extensive thought. We think this is important with the debate around abortion. Women's voices should be the most important around abortion. Not every man should be able to get up and say their opinion on abortion is equally important, because it's not when it doesn't affect them and it doesn't have a direct impact on their lives. The same thing with cisgender people constantly speculating about the transgender community, who don't get their subjective experience at all. We think that that's highly immoral, and the people who are stakeholders in that situation voices should be prioritized, not to the exclusion of objectivity, but right now it's objectivity to the exclusion of subjectivity.",constructive2,,nmcdowe,round3,nmcdowe_round3,1.0,79.0

And now they'll have to, if they do buy these houses, pay more money towards the average Canadian citizen, which can go towards social services, despite what opposition says.

Not to limit this to the scope of the United States, but right now there's such high political polarization with our current president. With President Trump, people are really clashing. Studies have come out that people of different political ideologies actually just spend less time together, and that's a big thing.

If there are these emotions, people feel really encouraged and the other side, brought up movements like Black Lives Matter and school shooting responses.

We think that public discourse is a fine thing, but we think that emotions can lead people to do really extreme things that can put themselves in danger and actually not help them defend their cause. We also think that the really big issue in this is gridlock in legislation.

So it's going to be difficult for two people who have had like vastly, vastly different levels of emotional experience to talk about politics and objectivity is a more effective way to do that. If someone has had all this huge background and someone doesn't have that big of a background knowing about these politics, I think that conversation is going to be really hard. But if it's mainly objective and we recognize the facts in the lace, then that will be credible, and about facts, right? You see even the speech after all these political speakers, there are fact checkers and the speeds come on and a lot of times what they say is false. I think people often blom onto that and I think if there was more objectivity, things would be fact-based and decisions would be made off what is true instead of what people hear. People often hear things and become emotional about it, but that's not necessarily the truth. And we think that's detrimental. For example, let's just imagine a hypothetical. Somebody grew up in a family that was racist, right? You grow up in a family that your parents do not like people of a different color, right? And then you grow up thinking that and you see a candidate who is very qualified but they fit that bill of being a different race and you don't support them because of your family bias. Right? People are inherently tethered to biases that they grow up with. And we think that leads to them skewing opinions when it could be they're ignoring the facts. We also can think someone got screwed over by a company, right? And then there's a candidate running who used to work in that company too, and they're not going to support them even if they're qualified just because their personal experiences hold them back.",constructive2,,mswan,round3,mswan_round3,1.0,78.0

If people have a lot of conversations that are about their emotions and those are what spread. But a lot of times in society, we live in a place where there is a lot of information and yet people still are not super informed as to what's going on. And we think that if there is more objectivity, there will be more facts involved and then decisions will be made based on those facts. Just a little bit for rebuttal too, they bring up the arguments that, okay, there are high school shootings and there are movements like Black Lives Matter and removing emotions eliminates the humanity of those things and eliminates the humanity of those movements.",constructive2,,mswan,round3,mswan_round3,1.0,78.0
1251,"Second question I want to bring up in this debate is why you get voters to come out and bring social cohesion. Because objective politics simply does not bring you enough justification on things such as care and empathy. What does that look like? It looks like the fact that political discussion would not be surrounded by John who said to that white police saying that, ""I want the best for you. I love you. Can I give you a hug?"" Right? These are things that will be subjected under our side and let us have the ability to unite people because these are incidents that will get African Americans to come out here and vote. Note the system that African Americans and minorities believe in are already flawed. They believe governments alienate them. That is why without subjective accounts saying that the person besides you might be killed and therefore you should come out to vote, those individuals would never turn out to the voting poll, and that is a greatest atrocity to an entire democratic practices, because democracy is premised on the fact that individuals have equal say. The moment when I only care about philosophical or political goals of mainly the very highest class form of objectivity is a moment when these individuals will be put in trains and never have their say in a political system. The ways in which you should engage with them therefore, is to feed into the society saying that your friends or your family members might be killed by white police, and therefore you should come up here and vote. The reasoning why we go for it in opening government is through the fact that we prove to you why subjectivity and objectivity can go in hand, and individuals will have the right to judge it by more to propose",constructive1,,wesleychiu,round3,wesleychiu_round3,1.0,79.0
598," Firstly, we say that subjective experiences often neglect to show whole pictures of problems and get to questions of solvency. So having an individual talk about how they were treated in a specific instance is incredibly useful to starting a conversation, but it isn't necessarily useful to solving it. So for example, it is a completely reasonable question to ask of like given that we have disparities in educational outcomes for women versus men, for example. It is unclear where in the educational process that happens or what stage we need to like combat it, which policies are the most effective in order to reduce discrimination. These are things that you can't get from an individual story. You need to look at a big picture. Because some people are affected differently in order to get a sense of which policies are the most effective at combating these things. In order to figure out which policies are actually going to be able to have the most change given limited resources you necessarily need look at science and data. I think that if you just listen to emotional appeal, you don't necessarily get whole big picture ideas for how to solve issues and things will be solved based on ... if politicians can get away with saying they're going to solve things by appealing to emotion. So for example, Justin Trudeau can say that he values the environment. He can go to the Environmental March and appeal to emotion by saying that he cares and then spend billions of dollars on a pipeline. You can appeal to emotion and not have policy. We'd our side that you actually need to prove that your policies work and that they are effective. You can't just lie to voters.

That is to say, we say the indigenous people that have their lands taken by coal miners and also the people that work in coal mines and die of black lung in the hundreds of thousands are often united on goals like reducing coal mining, which is bad for both of them. But they're often divided by emotional ideologies. Let's say that you can only vote for people that have similar backgrounds to you. We would say this means that voter turnout is much lower when you have coalitions. For example, the democratic party in the United States where you're representing hundreds of completely diverse backgrounds where you can only represent one singular politician and they are almost certainly not going to build or represent everyone. When you have objective fact, you can see how these issues are related to each other on a broad scale. How it affects tons of different people, and you get substantially more voter turnout and unity, which means you're not divided when you're fighting against the rich and powerful",constructive2,,jacobsilcoff,round3,jacobsilcoff_round3,1.0,78.0
1519,"But moving into the new extension, which is how exactly states are going or not going to comply. We're going to contend at our extension that states are very unlikely to comply when these are actually implemented. Part of the reason for this is exactly what Jimbo tells you in his last speech, which is if you're sufficiently able to predict that there will be economic harms to violating your voting for a policy that's going to violate religious freedoms, then you might choose not to vote for it. I.E. Those that are able to analyze economic beliefs and prioritize those over the radicalized religious or moral views are already going to be voting against this policy in the first place. The first reason, then, that states are unlikely to comply with this kind of enforcement is that their decision calculus hasn't changed. They are already aware of the financial harms prior to enacting it. Nothing has changed, we're getting the exact same financial harms that the government had promised with that one to two year period the opening government so kindly models for us. And in addition, we think that the states are going to be doing this are likely to be self-selecting for those that are financially economist regions, I.E. Those that are revenue positive rather than the federal government. Otherwise, they would unlikely make such a decision. For example, if you look at Catalonia, Catalonia is relatively revenue positive compared to Spain, so there's less of a net harm to having this funding cut off. There has been no team on side government bench that has explained why that decision calculus flips after the fact. I need to hear a lot more work on that to believe anybody's going to flip. Secondarily, I think that consistently people are more likely to vote off of radicalized beliefs than economic harms. Necessarily, the states that we're talking about are those in which the individuals hold what we would consider in this room to be radicalized views on what exactly religion is, and what religious liberties are. We think that and they probably prioritize those over economic harms given that they voted for this. ",constructive1,4.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0
1520,"Why is it that when this is implemented, that it's actually likely to get worse? First, we think there's an element of attribution. This was mentioned by our opening, that is that we're likely to blame the minorities, but wasn't fully mechanized. What we will you tell you then, is not only do they then blame the minorities, but as a result, that becomes further reason to then block those liberties. That is, if I think that the reason that my funding has been cut off is because of the religious expression of my Muslim neighbor, I'm now more likely to support harming the rights of my Muslim neighbor because I think that they're the ones that are directly responsible for the harms that I and my children are suffering. Secondarily, you'd think that since there are no actual economic benefits to banning these liberties in the first place, it necessarily means that when this decision was initially made, it was a non-economic decision. Third reason, the states are unlikely to comply. That's private support or the victim card. In other words, we think there was a substantial number of people, both within these states and outside of them, that support the radicalized view towards religion that they're taking on and want to be able to vote their independence. Particularly given that these are likely to be smaller regions relative to the total size of the country, because if there were larger regions, they would likely account for a larger voting block within the federal governments, which would then mean the federal government would be the one arbitrating in their favor. We think it's likely then, that there would be a potential for very wealthy, conservative millionaires and billionaires to contribute enough to keep these states solvent, even if they are revenue negative. For these reasons, we have a very time believing that states are going to comply. ",constructive2,5.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0
1521,"What is then going to be the response? We see a few possibilities. One possibility we think is very likely is that these states stop paying taxes. I'm not going to take it. Likely that they stop paying taxes, particularly because they're likely to be revenue positive, as we mentioned before. In addition, we think that they need to stay solvent. Cutting off taxes is one way to stay solvent. And in addition to that, there's now no incentive to pay taxes. I.E. The government has lost all of its leverage to enforce taxation and you're not going to pursue a military invasion, given this is more likely to happen in mountain country where you have a weaker federal government, otherwise it would have already been enforced. And because military invasions on a domestic front are always going to be unpopular. Why is it really, really bad if they stop paying taxes? One, all of the funding drops. This is actually implicitly dropping [OG from the debate. Here, their entire pace was contingent on having an increased amount of funding that then goes towards other groups once we know we're getting enough money off tax revenue, OG's out. But secondarily, it leads to further radicalization because now the government has literally no leverage. There is no financial relationship between the two, which allows them to radicalize further. I'll explain this more in a moment when we move to the second possibility, which is the secession. In many of these states, such as Quebec, which has already tried to vote for secession twice in the last four years, there's an active secession movement. Okay, secession is likely to happen because one, these are probably safe, so already one has a seat because they're ideologically opposed to the federal government. And secondarily, we think that this amplifies radical ideological differences. That is, that because religion is a fundamental belief, once you create an oppositional relationship about the radical beliefs with the government, you increase the incentive to withdraw.",constructive3,4.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0

I mean that you can use statistics all day long to say that the illegal abortions are more unsafe to the woman. That there is the constitutional understanding, a legalistic view that abortions should be legal, but it fails to actually capture the emotional nuance of life lived experience that that woman goes through. There is no statistic to show the hardship that it was to make the decision to have an abortion. There is no statistic that can actually give you this view. So we think that when we were talking about political discourse and what gives better debates, that if we include this more nuanced understanding of how these issues are affecting people then I think we get deeper and richer debates. my second point about why numbers doesn't actually elicit the response that gets y'all to the back half.",constructive1,,smcdade,round3,smcdade_round3,1.0,77.0

That is to say that throughout our day-to-day lives we're constantly bombarded with ""50 people died here"", ""50,000 people died here"", ""200 people died here"", that we become numb and we don't actually imagine the magnitude of what it means to have that numbers. Right? What do I mean by this? I mean that when I'm given just this random, big number, that now I just can wash it off and I don't internalize it as an actual human died; that 50 people actually died. It's much easier to see a number and think of it only as a number without seeing the human cost behind it. So we think that when we're talking about political debates and we're talking about the fact that these are about statistics and objectivity.

Right? What do I mean by this? I mean that as long as we are having this objectivity narrative and that that's what's going to be needed in this debate, we're always going to have racist people who are subjectively interpreting these things. So what do we see? We see that objectivity can't actually capture...  I know. Objectivity captures all the... Objectivity fails to capture all the human experience. It actually masks the human call and the subjectivity behind it. And, it can be used as a racist dog-whistling as long as subjective people are interpreting these ""objective statistics."" So what actually changes when we're doing this? When we're including these human experiences? We think we allow for richer, more human connection for that person. What do I mean by this? I think when you're able to actually see the... that person-to-person, what they lived through, it's much easier to actually have a connection with that person, and actually understand what they've been through, than it is to say just be like, ""Oh, we should do this for legal reasons."" I think it's important to understand this, if you want a real-world example, in the gay marriage movement. Right? We see a clear delineation before 2005 and after 2005 where the gay marriage movement was Before 2005, it was legalistic, it was all around constitutionality, and around why this is a right and they were trying to play it objectively. They saw no change in people's actually-perceived ideas about why gay marriage should be legal. We saw no shift in public opinion. But after 2005, we saw subjectivity come into the world where people actually showed that gay couples are couples and that their lived experiences are valid.

1612,"is way worse because they're actually able to act upon it. They're the ones that hold the levers of power in society and the moment they get this narrative in their hands, they weaponize it in ways that perpetuate injustice in our society and far exacerbate inequalities. What am I talking about? I'm talking about things like Rajputs in Rajasthan being able to get reservations in government jobs and reservations in universities because they painted themselves as a classic, deserves these rights having been the historical landowners in Rajasthan. What happened then? Does that country, or that state, lower class people in that state completely shut off from government jobs, completely shut out of universities because it's a privileged entitlement that these Rajputs held. What I'm talking about as well is that parents who have privilege, who have resources, will try to continue the illusion of their children being special. They don't want their children's bubble to burst because that is when children have these mental health breakdowns. Poor people, after a certain stage, poor parents are unable to continue this illusion because they can't buy their children their way through life. At some stage, the compassionate work person who tells the child, ""You're special, you're special, you're special"" while they continue to fail, while society continues to beat them down, stops working. But when you're rich, when you're Lori Laughlin and then you can buy your daughter's way into college, that is when you're able to keep that illusion going, you're able to keep the bubble going. What happens when you spend all your money trying to keep that illusion going? What happens is you perpetuate and generate further social inequity. You then rig college admissions, which disables underprivileged people. For me, it was an access education that allowed them to get social mobilities. You ensure that people feel resentment against a political system that seems to be rigged against those who are lacking privilege. This is by far the most important thing in this because these are people who actually have power, who have the power to continue to oppress minority because they believe they have a birthright to something they really don't have one to.

The amount that you have, it increases your credit drastically. You're perceived as a much more legitimate [Boone 00:04:09] business owner. You have all these benefits to having a home. You have a community around you that's able to sort of support you, you live in a neighborhood, et cetera.

People have the incentive to set those prices higher because people are still willing to buy their insurance from this competitive market through the tax that government has placed. So in a world where they definitely need a home and they're only in one market, rent prices can increase.

Not necessarily just because some people are greedy and want more space in their home, but it's the idea that you could have a generational piece of land that you can maybe pass down to your children. Or at the very least, once your children graduate school and leave the house to go to university, you can downsize your house, sell the excess money from there, and then use that extra money that you made in the property appreciating over your lifetime to move into a retirement home.",constructive1,,coreyd405,round1,coreyd405_round1,1.0,77.0

So the question here now is, what does the new wave of how families spend their money look like? I think in this system, when you're disincentivizing house ownership, this also includes condos and all of that, you're just like forcing people to live inside apartments where they're necessarily constantly paying rent to: a.

Or rather than that money going back into their families and being able to invest in those family's futures, it's now probably going to a baldy landlord who already has a robust amount of capital just off of the virtue that these landlords already have the money to own these buildings in the first place.

Disincentivizing home ownership takes away one of the most classic ways that people view investments.

It's acquainting your self worth with what you know is the best you can be. I think that removes the negative reinforcement that inevitably comes when you fail that only exists on said government. Okay, I think also what's going to differentiate us from our front half is we're going to talk to you about practical worth. They talked to you substantially more about principles. Okay, let's talk about kids who are constantly reinforced when their children... When kids fail though some of this came out of my reputation. So any note, when parents constantly have to reinforce that their kids are special or good, whatever conception you take.

I think this leads to things like, ""oh I can drunk drive I know it's dangerous but it won't affect me. I can try drugs, I probably won't have a bad reaction because I'm special so I know it won't hurt me. You think that you're exempted from the rules because you're special. Okay.

We don't think that it's the case, that in this world, now, there are no trade schools. Or if there are trade schools, they are solely private and nobody can afford them. Or that there are no community colleges. We simply have changed the funding priority. We also think that it's the case that employable people sort of fill these gaps in employment that they say don't exist, in order to fulfill the needs of early childhood care because of the lack of post-secondary education. It's precisely why that in order to have these benefits, we need the greater funding, in order to incentivize these people. Rather to flee the country, rather to go somewhere else, but rather to stay because there's a financial incentive to be a early childhood care physician, or psychologist, et cetera, or an educator in an existing country due to the priority given to this by the government in terms of funding. We think that creating this kind of financial incentive means that we solve for harm of lack of employability in these positions, that might be caused by an absence of post-secondary education, but also that post-secondary education at least the absence is mitigated by the fact that we aren't scrapping this entirely, and then just pressing to a sufficient degree that we can make up for in the long run the absence of having tons of early childhood care psychologist such that this becomes a lower cost in the longterm and we are able perhaps to shift priority later or to maintaining this priority but do so even greater effectiveness, creating even less educational inequity in the longterm because of the educational inequities that, as my partner tells us, start very early in childhood and therefore need to be resolved at that time.",constructive2,,srao3,round2,srao3_round2,0.0,75.0

We think that it's the case that parents who are overburdened by childcare are unable to create the kind of conditions necessary to allow their own children to go to college, to create an environment for their children to attend school because it's more likely for it to be the case that due to subsidize the childcare costs that they have to incur, that may have forced them to work less, to force, in many countries, mothers to remain in the home rather than to continue working to perhaps make it such that their children have to, rather than pursuing post secondary education, take care of their own parents starting from a much younger age because their own parents were unable to advance their own careers or just save up enough money to allow them to be secure so that their children could pursue their own lives which we get by alleviating the burden of parents when they need to take care of their children at a young age.

Secondarily, we think it's worth noting that Russia is also in a seriously economic downturn. They have lifted massive amounts of money in the last years, a military spending that has not brought in the revenue that they thought it would. Their oil revenue has dropped consistently, especially after sanctioning from Europe over the past five years. We think that Russia's goals in addition to trying to establish its middle Eastern military base in order to be able to airstrikes, it's probably also could you this as an opportunity to expand in economic opportunities by using Syria as leverage for negotiations and OPEC and to better control the oil trading business's substantial number of their exports. For those reasons, we think there also has priority interest that can outlay from of the military interests we're talking about here. First argument is Russian optics. Let's be really clear, despite what we're going to hear from opening government, Hezbollah is globally recognized as a terrorist actor. Even if you believe every single they are going to tell you about how there's faith building is sending him money. Regardless of all of that, they are still recognized as a terrorist organization for optical purposes. What does that mean? So far, Russia has pollinated Hezbollah within Syria. They have not bombed them, but they also have not directly supported them or armed them. The moment that Russia now publicly acknowledges cause recognize have already been implicitly backwards and higher time as a sheer force in Syria. The only switch here is Russia is now officially recognizing that they support Hezbollah, a globally recognized terrorist group. This we think is likely to be the tipping point at which countries around the world have to withdraw their support for Russia both economically and militarily. A few things are likely to happened.

We care about the Israeli government thinks and the connections that they have to the US government. What does the Israeli government think of the US government right now? It's an instance of which Trump is viewed as the most heavily American influenced leader, buy the US Israel lobby in the last 20 years. It's a government in which Trump's voter base, a dominantly religious voter base in the United States, has explicitly prioritized Israel over Russia in past polling instances. We think this is unlikely to be sufficient despite factors to think that the US won't intervene. Secondarily, even if you don't think that the US will intervene, we still think that the Israeli defense force is more than enough of a deterrent factor. These forces is one of the most advanced military in the world. The iron dome alone composing of ground to air missile systems knocked down almost any potential Russian plane in the area would knock down more casualties technologically than Russia saw through the entire intervention in Syria. Not to mention all the other kinds of advanced technologies implemented by Mossad from robot killer flies that can peck you on the neck and kill you. Russia does not have the technology to be able to compete and we don't think they're going to be sending in ground troops, but it's going to be sending the helicopters to get shot down. Secondarily, we think that they're likely to be able to call Russia's bluff. That is what Russia has an incentive to try to deter Israel the moment that Israel decided they want to invade, Russia has no incentive to respond. That is that they don't actually have any incentive other than the signaling to start a very, very costly war with Israel.

The Zionist lobby in Israel views this as a religious war and views Hezbollah and the Iranian army as a threat on the religious views of its people. In Israel's history religious independence has always taken precedence over geopolitical gates.

We think that there is a sentient human life and rights that specifically can be intuited by the fact that I believe that I have gotten it personally, and I can project that to others, and see that others who are similar to me use that heuristic to decide that other people have value. And basically this is very foundational to our society that generally speaking, society believes this and so reporting values that are society is going to be useful. Additionally, we think that most parents, almost all parents, will believe that their children are special. It's simply true that most parents believe that this is true, which is why this is something that parents tell their kids all the time. And we think of it as usually wrong for parents to lie to their kids, unless there's a specific reason, that it's going to harm them. So if they truly believe their kids are special, then they should say that to and to their kids.

Clearly this is going to be very psychologically harmful to the kid. It is not going to be good for their development. I'll give you a at this point and it is going to often destroy their sense of self from an early age. This is likely to cause a lot of problems in their lives. Specifically, they're less likely to be socialized effective other kids if they're constantly worried about demonstrating their self-worth. We think that there's a resilience that comes from knowing that you're special because your parents tell it to you and that specifically when you interact with the world and you don't believe that you are inherently valuable, that when other people put you down, you're likely to be much more effected by this. So it magnifies those effects. We also think that specifically you can intuit. Like I said, you can Intuit that because you have dignity others have it, others have it too. And so kids are much less likely to see that in other people they're treating people around them well if they don't believe that they themselves have that dignity, which just going to be very bad. But additionally we think that specifically teaching this message is good for personal utility, because you think that meaning of life comes from the striving for things, right? So basically there are things that you want to achieve. You work towards them and you build up and you try to achieve them. Now the meaning doesn't necessarily come from achieving all the things that you want to try to achieve. Sometimes you'll fail, right? But that doesn't mean that there isn't value in striving for those things, that specifically, people generally find work that works towards a goal meaningful, like we think that things that are iterative and build upon things are generally the places that people are going to get the most value out of life, as opposed to things that are more just... You have to eat every day. Eating as enjoyable, one sound that's certainly meaningful, right? And so people are much more likely to find this meeting.

We also think that specifically when people fail, they're much less likely to get back on the horse if they don't think they have dignity, and if they don't think they're special. Specifically people are much more likely to spiral into depression when they're... And if they were told that they were special, they will continue to fight for things, they'll thank you, even when they fail and that because they believe that they deserve better, because they're pretty working, they'll continue to work even in the face of defeat, which is a good thing for them personally because they're generating meaning and they're most likely to accomplish things despite deterrence. But the other reason we think this is important is for societal good overall. Remember, all people who do great things believe that they are special, right? There are so many innovators. We think that generally speaking one individual person or individual people are kind of the drivers of major innovations in society, right? You look at like Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla, as being great examples of technological innovators. There are all sorts of people who come up with some sort of unique idea, believe they can change the world in some way. And it's true a lot of those people fail, but it doesn't matter, because every single one of them believe. They think if they didn't believe that they could change the world, they wouldn't even try. And so it's really important to incentivize all people to think this way or else we'll never have these big innovations, we'll never have these big societal gains over the long run, right? Specifically, we think, going back to the determining failure point, that it's really important to foster these bright minds, the most important people in our society, the innovators, and to teach them this from a young age, because if they never learned it, then our society stagnates and it never gets anywhere.

You are able to talk and have discussions about what minorities think is important through policy decisions, not just focus on these pleased emotionality. Also, remember that when people focus on that subjective experience, they only focus on their subjective experience and not the subjective experience of others. They will be so stuck in the echo chambers that they won't even be able to see the other side. So let's talk about conservatives. Oftentimes we think they're angry and they miss the nuance of policy because they're stuck in their echo chamber as well. We also think moderates feel excluded when only talking about exclusion. We all know that there is a silent majority that doesn't get their voice heard because they feel that they don't fit into either of the echo chambers. So we get more sustained coalitions on our side of the house. Think about an issue like healthcare. A lot of the nuance about healthcare is not focused on the values of either side. From both sides, yell at each other, they bisque each other and go to any nuance of the situation.",constructive1,,jbotkin1,round3,jbotkin1_round3,0.0,74.0

These people can overcome issues when they talk about objective issues themselves, rather than emotional appeals that exclude certain narratives and make people angry or when people are less angry, able to focus on policy, we think you are able to get better policy, more progressive policy passes. This is really important because it helps everyone in society. So for instance, if you have a country like the US passing healthcare reform, you don't get that if you have Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi yelling at each other. But you do get that if you have politicians that are able to focus on the new wants and represent the views of the silent majority by focusing on this idea of policy. Now let's also talk about the nature of political conversation. We think when people are able to see across the differences, they're able to find similarities and this results in the right turnout in the ballot box. We think you get issue oriented voters, right? You get money in political campaigns being spent on education of people about the issues rather than people fighting about political feuds themselves.

1417,"So to start off, I'm going to be talking about how the need of a bachelor's degree is more prominent now than ever has in our world, our society. Scholarships are absolutely essential for getting a higher level jobs in education. Even with trade school nowadays, you want to be a plumber, you want to be electrician, you want to be any, any person in that age, you still need to have a higher education in order to achieve these goals. And for that reason, people who are maybe educated from a young age, maybe lose that education that they have because they're so young and when they get to this point in time where they need to apply these, they need to go apply these traits that they've learned as a young kid, they may be disconnected from that and not be able to take advantage of that. And therefore if they don't get those scholarships and they don't get those things that they need in order to go to school and they don't end up at those schools, they thus will not be able to survive in the real world and survive in life. Just to point out is how important these higher educations are compared to these primary schools. These higher education resources are so much more needed due to the fact that those are the places where you're actually learning about doing those jobs. You're actually learning about how to plumb, you're actually learning how about to do this. In a more liberal arts sense, you're learning about how to read higher level texts, how to do these things. That's something you're not going to learn as a child. And even if you have good, strong mental health and you have a good strong foundation, that foundation won't bring you that far as you need it because you still will need to be able to survive in and learn these upper level higher education.

I think it was really not touched upon as well by the opening government as I'd like. This is due to the fact that when you're from the age of zero to five, zero to six, from this young age is yes, it absolutely is a very important time for cognitive development and for emotional development. I cannot disagree to that point, but the point of the matter is, you guys had mentioned if these children are raised up in these really harsh household and these really tough environments that they're going to be able to learn these skills and apply them to their further life. I'm sorry, but I don't really remember as much information from when I was zero to five years old as I do now from college alone, from high school. And so even if these are innate emotional learnings that they're having, there's still going to be set up in that. They're still going to be living in that certain household that that was rough and abusive. They're still going to be living in that environment that they're trying to learn how to cope with. But those coping strategies can only take you so far. You're going to be in an environment where you are going to be subjected to this throughout high school, throughout middle school, arguably times where your mental health is the most important because you're learning how to build relationships, you're learning how to, how to balance life in school and to be still in that subjective zone and not be able to have a college future ahead of you is something that would be even more detrimental to their mental health.",constructive2,3.0,squeeze,round2,squeeze_round2,0.0,74.0

And scholarships in the best way possible motivate these kids throughout their middle school, high school careers to work and strive towards gaining these scholarships because they know it will give them the opportunity to access college in the first place. And so if you take away the opportunity from them and they know that they won't have its fullest extent, then you're going to be subjected in a zone where they will be less motivated and less desire to go and work for these scholarships and work for these opportunities because they're not going to be there in the first place. And so additionally these opportunities can, in college, once you're in there, once you are actually there, this funding is thus more representative in as an extension to what my partner had said in study abroad programs and club teams and varsity sports. These are all different aspects of college life that require funding and require money. And if these kids are not given that funding in the first place, even if they make it to college, they won't be able to access these resources that are utmost valuable for their learning and their development. Being able to go to different countries and get cultural understandings. Being able to be part of the team and being able to play with one another and learn, bonding. These are things that are extremely important for these kids and far outweigh the stuff that they will learn as zero to five years old. It is something that they will use for the rest of their life and put on job resumes and put on applicants and be able to have that and use that to propel them further in life. And that is why it is so, so important that they have it.

1481,"Emotional support from their parents. Parents are key for three specific reasons. The first is that there's an inherent bond between a child and a parent. This is both biological and psychological. Because a child is born from a parent, they feel a closer bond to them than say a random person and therefore parents are uniquely key for reinforcing messages and teaching children skills. The second is just a time bond. Because children and parents spend so much time together, children obviously care more about what their parents say than any other adult or person in their lives. And the last one is that even in cases where parents don't necessarily have the resources to shower kids with gifts, some kind of verbal affirmation or verbal support from parents is very key to making sure that children do get the same similar experience as kids of a higher socioeconomic status and still get some baseline level support from parents. Our model is very simple. We advocate for parents reinforcing that children are special from an early age. This is reinforced to be primarily verbal, but it would also be just to make sure that children know and understand they're special from an early age and that would be communicated by their parents.",constructive1,4.0,arjunp,round6,arjunp_round6,0.0,75.0
1482,"Our first argument is that it results in self-actualization and a feeling of purpose. This is a principled argument because we believe that every single child deserves the right to self-actualization and the right to discover their purpose in society. Self-actualization is at the top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and currently some children don't have the opportunity to achieve that because of a lack of verbal support and a lack of emotional support from an early age. The process that we believe results in self-actualization is simple. There's a verbal reinforcement that occurs at an earlier age. Children reinforce these verbal messages and start to understand them. When they're told that they're special, they start to feel that they're special and act in a certain way. After that, children are able to discover their purpose and their goals. As children get older, these goals get more specific and more oriented towards perhaps careers or things that they want to do to help the community. Eventually, once people discover their purpose and their goals, dating all the way back from an early age, they'd reach self-actualization, and understand that they have a niche role in society. Telling children they're special means they become special because of modeling and internalization. Children, as I said earlier, are very impressionable at an early age, so being told they're special, will likely make them feel that they're special. The reason that this is good is because it allows children to pursue individual goals. This book helps society as a whole because it means way more people will be pursuing specific goals, likely for the betterment of society, and also make sure that children of all access levels, and children of all backgrounds do get to pursue their goals and do get to feel like they have a positive meaning of life, and do get to feel like they have a purpose in life. We think that this is a principle that everyone should be able to access.",constructive2,4.0,arjunp,round6,arjunp_round6,0.0,75.0
1483,"Our second main argument is that children feeling special at a young age, and getting more support from their parents, is likely to reduce teen and young adult suicides. The reason that suicides often happen is because people don't have a purpose to live or a specific reason to live. They don't think that life is worth living and in a lot of cases that is because of lack of support structures. They haven't had sufficient support structures from an early age, so they don't have these resources in their life to understand that they're special and they deserve to live. The impact of suicides is that tangible human lives are lost, particularly young adults. And teenagers are particularly vulnerable because when they have stressful lives and when they don't understand exactly how they fit in, how they feel special, all of these things, they are more likely to commit suicide and that's something that we think we have an ethical obligation to prevent. When we have a situation rampant in society where there's so many people largely of low income backgrounds who don't feel that they have a need in society and don't feel like they fit into society, we do have a role as any governing body or as any member of society to help them and prevent this problem from becoming any worse.

1484,"in countries like the United States are often in bad public school systems so they don't necessarily have good education. There are good teachers there. They don't have the kind of teacher who would give them emotional support. They don't always have the kind of teacher who makes them feel special, makes them feel like, they are benefiting from life. There's a big socioeconomic gap in parental support right now. Largely, rich parents, parents of better socioeconomic backgrounds are going to provide more support to their children, both financial and just time commitment. Whereas in a lot of cases poor children don't have the same resources. We believe that by pursuing this motion and specifically the model that opening gap presents, we will give all children access to this kind of verbal support. So obviously it's not the same level of financial support in a lot of cases, but it is still giving every single child that baseline level of support that helps them making sure that they have some emotional attachment to parents and these children also feel like they have a purpose. The reason this is important is because getting this parental support is important to future achievement which results in income ability for these people. So the problem with the current system in the United States and a lot of other countries is that people are stuck in whatever class they're reporting. If they were born into the lower socioeconomic class, they're not going to rise. A big part of this is obviously the level of finances that they have and also the amount of support and resources around them and we believe that obviously we're not getting, our model is not giving everyone money, but rather it's giving them support from an early age. It's really important because children are impressionable. They have to form goals at an early age and have to learn that goals are important. By doing this at an early age, we are increasing their potential for achievement and therefore their potential for income ability, which is a key impact in this round because poverty is one of the biggest problems in countries all over the world and if we have children given more support from an early age this poverty system is largely resolved.

1485,"Our fourth main argument is that feeling special and kids feeling that they have a place in society is key to community building. Particularly in both communities. There is a phenomenon called the ""do-good feel-good"" phenomenon. When kids feel good, when they feel like their efforts are recognized and they feel like they're special from an early age, they're more likely to do good things and do things that are beneficial to society all across their vitals. We believe that community building, particularly in low-income in communities is one of the most important things that can be done and one of the most important initiatives any government can try to do. Because if we build up these communities from the youngest generation, we have future cycles of kids trying to do achievements, kids trying to help their community, kids trying to build things in their community. That's one of the best ways to escape from an endless cycle of poverty because if we continue to have kids who don't have our pre-achievements, who don't have support structures from an early age that can lead to concrete achievements, we get communities that are perpetual ruins and communities that perpetually don't have role models.

What's happening is due to practices like and voter suppression, the majority of the population is able to overwhelmingly, at some points, even 60% vote against the legislature that will end up being elected.

We think that the gap in terms of state funding can easily be filled by alumni who get to see their school, What preschool did you go to? Can you tell me its name? I think not. When was the last time somebody donated to the preschool they went to? Right? That doesn't happen. But alumni love pouring money in droves. We think that universities can very easily say, Hey, what, we're losing money, we're losing grant money. We're not going to get the best and brightest students. Give us money and very easily they're going to be able to get that from either corporations that want to see the best and brightest trained so that they can go out into the workplace and contribute to those companies and we're going to see alumni who see their colleges in crisis knowing that they're not going to get access to the best scholars because they're going to get taken away by the schools with massive endowments and they're going to give money so that you still have access to those universities.T he state is not necessary to fund universities. Other actors can fill those gaps. But the state is necessary to fill daycare because people don't donate to it. Corporations aren't like aching over it because they don't know. Microsoft doesn't know if funding a preschool is going to get them the next best computer programmer. They know that funding a state college to have more programmers is going to allow them to actually select that pool of talent. We think therefore that that has to be a better replacements.

1557,"So for the first question, who are we talking about here and where are we talking about? So comes and says we're talking about two groups or religious minorities that should be protected by government. And then the second group is other minorities who will lose funding and then scapegoat religious minorities. I think as a whole, my partner did a very good job of uniquely classing at them. He points out that there's no link work for why a different minority i.e. an impoverish, person would instantly blame a religious minorities when obviously hyper conservative governments are the ones to blame. He does great analysis how it's way more reasonable to expect that they will collectively recognize that they're all marginalized groups and are you fighting against the central government, rather than just committing hate crimes on religious minorities. That's something they can play that opening opposition does not link out. But furthermore, they talk about the ideas that it's too dangerous to show religion, so the government should protect it. But I think that's a very patronizing argument. I think the idea is it even if it's more dangerous to wear a burka, or to have the star of David and we just value people's own agency and there's decision to decide what is safe or what is too dangerous for them. That even if we do accept and acknowledge that there is a unique danger for the specific religious minorities, they have a right to determine whether or not they can wear something, even if it raises their harm. But what my partner uniquely brings to you is how the analysis, how, all white people feel justified. I think this is mentioned opening government that my partner takes a better example, explaining about how I'm more likely to feel justified by the government. And he also does better clashing with opening opposition about why religious minorities will not scapegoated, except by the Alt-right, which they already are in the status quo.",constructive1,4.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0
1558,"So about this, the second question is how does government funding cause change? I think that this was a big point of opening government, but I think what my partner does that such unique contribution that places us over opening government, is he uniquely talks about specific examples that was mentioned but actually goes into details. Opening government did a good job mentioning in the 1960s and the civil rights movement but they kind of stopped there. My partner Sam brings you about how this was funding specifically go towards regions where they didn't want to segregate schools and how these parents, regardless of how hyper conservative they were, how did eventually allow their schools to be integrated. And I think that he also mentioned the unique example about how state roads and how federal funding for road budgeting was then used to lower the drinking age. So I think the fact that he takes these examples and uses them better than opening government should be considered for one of the many reasons why he plays above them. But I also think the fact that his examples show more in detail how this generally works clashes directly with opposition and opening opposition when they see that these areas are hyper conservative and don't care and points out how regardless how conservatives are past presidents show they will care.",constructive2,4.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0
1559,"So now for the third and final question, that's what my partner's main extension is and the most important thing that I brought, and that's how federal funding used and how its maintained to protect all minorities. My partner brought unique principle and practical analysis into that. He says that this has true values to a one transactional that just on principle, federal funding is a transactional thing. It's just not an obligation, which is something that opening opposition and just says it is that reality is it's a chip that the federal government's like, ""We give you this if you realistically obey our ideologies and laws"" and they'll state governments are going to be like, ""Yes."" So when the state governments refuse to, even if it does work a small group of people that no longer get some access to welfare things, the government is obligated to take away the transactional chip because the contract's broken. But even more importantly and how we get the fact that the government consistently protects all minorities on a national level and what my partner brings you the idea of value consistency. And the idea is that when the federal government decides what receives federal funding and what doesn't, they decided this is a value that they will, that they believe everyone in their nation should consistently receive that when the government is on a nonnegotiable table on this thing, that it shows a value consistency that shows that normally since the president or other States that they removed funding for this. Then when the government's like ""Religious groups are protected, people of color are protected, like LGBT people are protected."" That it only has value in the consistency and upholding it",constructive3,3.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0

Why these weaponizing counter narratives not the biggest issue that we're facing? Because first, I think that normative policy over increasing statistics is going to become a new norm. Notably a lot of policy is made by the rich and wealthy and racial majorities. Meaning, if they are able to just keep using those statistics, keep saying, ""Let's increase our efficiency from 30% to 35%,"" and that is the only angle in which they're trying to achieve, this is particularly harmful because they're easily able to ignore all the minority populations that are also affected by these policies. What changes our government? We think that there was no statistic ever to suggest that having minority liberation and integrating a more inclusive workspace and having more inclusive hiring practices at all ever suggested that we've increased efficiency. In a world of objectivity, that would never be a play, but when individuals are able to talk out and say, I think inclusivity is important. My lived experiences of being marginalized have been very harmful for me to get into the workplace, then I think then policy is going to change in a different way in which we no longer care about increasing efficiency. We are now turning towards a world in which we ought believe it should be. Statistics can't tell us how we should go about that number. If we just try to increase efficiency, but using lived experiences allows us to contextualize what world we want to live in, not just how do we increase efficiency. I think that is incredibly important. This is why stories help the contextualization of our messages. This is why the minority populations are already...

We think that it's important for these governments to just make kind of a peg currency so that other governments cannot exploit them on the international stage.

If you cannot work with a hijab, then you do not have to wear the hijab. That means that religions make allowances for these things so it is not a complete violation of your religion because there are accommodations that can be made.

You have a smaller body of people, so therefore your vote has more impact. We say the people of Quebec know far better what is important for Quebec than these federal bodies because they are far more distant. They have the cultural differences, and it's just a huge group of people you are counting for the interests of a much smaller group of people. We say that the federal government does not have the right to decide of the interests of Quebec specifically.

1538," So now let's get into that short term, long term analysis. When government stopped funding, these things there are unintended longterm consequences. Let's talk about the damage done to parks and wildlife. When we saw a government shutdown, Washington DC state government stopped working, it stopped paying its workers, it stopped maintaining its parks and we saw longterm damage to landlords of the Washington monument. We saw parts in that area getting absolutely trash and the leaves filling up and trash cans. And what does that do? One, it damages the local wildlife in the area in the short term, but also now the Washington monument is damaged forever because there weren't people there to keep it under watch, to repair it when they could and to ensure that nothing like that happened in the first place. Because when you defund programs like this, you put public assets at risk and you put public land at risk and we say that the loss goes beyond that, right? When you defund these things, even if it's just for a few days, government workers without pay, they kind need money to live. Rent doesn't get delayed because the government isn't paying you, health and medical bills don't get delayed because the government isn't paying you. Defamation of wages for days or possibly months can prevent them from paying for their basic needs or upkeeping bills. And while we do believe that the case of religious freedom is important, and we want these people to have it, we believe that ultimately the most powerful mechanism for doing self isn't going to be what has been proposed on our government side. But ultimately going through courts at not having a ground shaking effect and possibly taking longer, will not hurt the vast majority of people existing within a state.

The federal government is beholden to all of its citizens, because of the way it works. When you live in a democracy, you consent basically to be governed by the state and the federal government. The federal government represents people over at large and things like that that. Like this whole thing there. Right? So, if it's in the state's constitution, that means that all citizens of that state are going to be ... all that country are beholden to that constitution. It's like a set of principles that we all agree to by consenting into it. Right? I think there's just a great debate over; how do you consent to a state?

Our collective group of people are right and we're going to pursue these laws"". Right? What does this do? This looks like the danger of nullifying what federal law is. It means that when states started saying; ""we're only going to follow X, Y but we're not going to follow Z "", you start getting this question of; well great, if this state's going to follow this law, then why should California follow like economic regulation that they don't agree with president Trump, right?",constructive2,3.0,bfalkofs,round5,bfalkofs_round5,0.0,73.0

This is important for the point of actualization because trying out these things towards deciding who you are, what do you want to take from life is, if you represent to all of this as Daryl sort of already explained to you in your speech, right? We're told that you're special that Oh, this is actually telling him if necessarily better. Right. Better does not necessarily imply special. Right? One culture can be different from another culture very clearly, and if you look very clearly one can be special but does not imply that one culture is superior to another. I think that here's what we're teaching is that to be as an individual you have innate value.

It's true that other individuals have this innate value, but nevertheless every individual is special and they are valuable because of that, and they deserve to be able to pursue their conception of their good life because they're individuals and because special. Special does not imply that you're the only person who deserves this. It simply implies that you are deserving of this because of your own uniqueness, because of your own specialness as an individual.

When you don't have this all the harms that Darryl talks about that they don't actually refute, so I don't even need to integrate responses into it because we don't get any analysis on the philosophy of why necessarily, tutored as a parent, you have these obligations towards cultivating this idea of actualization and the only way for you to actually cultivate actualization, is for, to give space for our children to grow up believing that necessarily they have value sort of regardless of what they do, is their value regardless and they shouldn't be afraid of doing things, they shouldn't be afraid of discovering with themselves because whatever they discover it is still valuable and is still deserving of their own love and respect.",constructive1,2.0,eslondon,round6,eslondon_round6,0.0,75.0

I think that we're better off on pragmatics because we're still giving the turn of the best question, sort of best answering the question of how we guide a child, right? As I said earlier, we're not defending telling the child that they're better if they don't need to try. We're saying that any child should try as much as they can because when they try they can achieve anything, because they're an individual and because they had his own potential as an individual, you should try because trying maximizes this all of these special qualities that you have as an individual. Not simply that you are better. Right. So it's necessarily true that what they say is, Oh yes, like psychologists say it's better to put pressure on them and not have them grow complacent. But the question is, should you tell them not to be complacent because otherwise they'll be useless or should you tell them not to be complacent because otherwise they're a failure or otherwise they're missing out on a chance to discover the great person who they are? I think that being told that look, whilst you have great potential, it's much more encouraging and also interesting for you to do it because I'd rather for it to be told that I can do good things rather than be told that I'm a bad person by the tone I love. But also, more importantly if you're, so if you're sort of experimentation in life is sort of based on only a sort of a training based on the idea of, you have to avoid failure, if you fail once then you're much more likely to deterred.

But also it's things like, for example, not having control of your home or being under a landlord or someone also increases your chances of sickness, poor conditions and, in general, unsafety. And the thing is, under landlords it's very hard to actually fix those situations because of things like, for example, bureaucracy that's been set up through lobbying of local town governments; and it's been set up to make sure that people have the right to be able to address their concern, especially when serious stuff like people getting sick, but also that it's not your home.

These are people who will be buying homes either way and these are people who have higher socioeconomic standing, and who in that case are going to be having that building to get this without having to sacrifice their entire lives. But even past that, I'd also like to acknowledge that this harms marginalized groups, I don't think government properly addresses that. First of all, I just want to mention that there are two types of people who are going to be affected by this resolution. First type of people are people who are going to be able to afford homes either way, and are just going to do so out of more diminishing return or at a rate at which would be a hindrance to the return. These are people who will be buying homes either way and these are people who have higher socioeconomic standing, and who in that case are going to be having that building to get this without having to sacrifice their entire lives.

The amount of people who are actually poorly affected by this on the other hand are people who are in that case, aren't able to afford homes, or barely able to afford homes in the current status quo. People who are barely able to reach their mortgage payments, who are barely able to get these homes under their balance statements that we're getting back, who are struggling to make ends meet. When you increase the taxes, you make it so that these people aren't able to actually get the homes that they need and they aren't able to get all the benefits that Tyler talked to you beforehand. And cutting these people, who are barely able to afford their homes out of economy is what leads towards things like rent that Tyler talked about. There were entire races of people and communities weren't able to afford homes, weren't able to impress in society and gain socio economic standing because of the fact that they weren't able to buy a home, get by that wall and climb the ladder in that sense.

Mortgage companies and people who own debt are going to notice that and raise another cost on you because of the fact that you are more than likely to default and not be able to pay back the payment. This makes you even less likely to afford this home in the future, especially if you already have the worst credit score which typically happens much more often in these poor communities, and it'll affect the poor much more throughout the bottom part of that area I was talking before, where you're already struggling to make ends meet, where you're already struggling to afford that home in the first place.

And again, the people this hurts the most are people who can barely afford housing in the status quo already.

And that's why they exist there, not because rich people... sorry And essentially if you get them moving towards things like owning rental businesses, or trying to get a stake in stuff like that instead, you are just getting them onside for the people who are currently trying to exploit and gouge away from people who are the most vulnerable in society.

615,"objective part of it is, because everyone is looking at it from, from a purely, from a completely emotional standpoint and they're not able to actually see what, what the, what the actual thing is. So, you end up with the, with these rhetoric attacks and these ad hominine attacks, like, like we've seen in so many of the presidential debates in the United States over the past five years and you see that happening in places like on The Time as well, where, where political candidates are attacking each other and sort of actually attacking each other's, each other's policy or their, their ideas for policy, right? We, we, on our side, we get people having conversations about the impacts that mattered to them instead of just how the facts pertain to them, right? So, so let's look at an example of this opposition product. The, the thing with police brutality and the Black Lives Matter Movement. Well, what do we get with subjectivity? What we get when we're having a conversation on Black Lives Matter, what subjectivity is, you get a large group of people saying that, ""Oh these, the group of people that's All Lives Matter..."", they say that the, the, the BLM people are either too reactionary or they're, or they're saying stuff like, like, ""Oh, they're radical or, or, or, they don't want the best for society. When you look at what's actually going on objectively, when you, when you see what, what's actually happening to these people and you have, you have the people in these political debates talking about what is actually happening within those communities and within the wider community, you can get people start to see the actual harms of, of, of, maybe not having this Black Lives Matter Movement or the harms that these people are actually advocating against. Instead of, when you're, when, when it's subjective, you get all these people talk, just talking about how, ""Oh that problem, that doesn't even matter to me, because I'm not black, so I don't care about it and in my own personal subjective narrative, it does not matter to me."" Right? But when you're talking about an objective, you get to see the actual harms to all of society that, that seems sorts of things have.",constructive1,,nmasoom,round3,nmasoom_round3,0.0,74.0
616,"What does, the second thing my partner brings me is that objective debate reduces the polarity that we see in political systems all over the world increasing today, right? Everyone, when you, when you take a debate from a more objective standpoint, you end up looking at and analyzing the same facts, right? Everyone is looking at the same facts and the same objective reality and then, from that standpoint, while you may be coming from... while people themselves, may be coming from different subjective experiences, we can all come to more similar conclusions when we're all looking at the same facts instead of debating the facts themselves. No, thank you. So, you get to, so what people do instead of being taught, instead of being told what to think by these polit... by these subjective politicians, instead they're told the facts and they're told the impacts of the policies that these politicians want to put into place, and from that they get to make their, their, they, they get to make their, they get to make their own analysis of, of what actually happens. Like with the whole abortion debate, instead of just having a reactionary subjective response to people and being like, ""Oh, they want to, they want to murder children"", instead you get to see what the benefits of like funding a planned Parenthood in a community actually has and how maybe that doesn't negatively affect you so much that you shouldn't allow other people to have abortions or things like that.

That's to say, when you enter into the social contact with your government, in the cases that you're put into bad situations, like you lost your job and you're unable to afford rent, you're unable to afford a living space, the government has the duty to protect you from these encroaching capitalistic pursuits by the rich elite who just wants to buy houses for their investment programs.

That's to say, we don't want rights in our world in which either they're one, inequitable, that means that you have more rights than other people simply because you've been able to like make it further in society. But secondly that you shouldn't have these rights if you're using these to actively harm others.

723,"So onto the practical argument, two layers under this. Firstly, is that we're going to deter people from buying additional houses that they don't need. But what exactly is the benefit from having this policy? Two things, firstly is that these people, instead of buying houses, which then they're going to be taxed exponentially on, they can spend their money in other areas of business. For example, they can donate to things like charity or they can donate to other businesses that they run in order to make more profits. We think that switching their focus from simply real estate investment into other forms of business would be better because at least they don't result in the practical harms of homelessness that we see in today's society.

1319,"know factually shown are put in place. So this other tube, we can go either way. It can work for the good of the country, as in actually acknowledging the structural areas, or it could be the other way and deny the good of the country and deny these structural barriers exist. We say with objectivity, you have a much more chance of acknowledging the structural barriers. So identity politics would become about branding. Elections would be based on this. Political discourse would become focused on experiences rather than policy. This will happen because politicians would be more concerned about building up their ethos over their policy and tearing down other ethos. Elections would become about who was a better candidate. Not in the sense of, are they going to do better things for our country, but who we'd rather want running us. And then their ethos would be elected. So politicians won't be seen as their idea, they'd just be seen as their sum of their experiences. Which is problematic in multiple ways. One, because politicians need to represent people who have different experiences than just their own. There are very few people who've lived the exact same lives as the politician has currently lived. So they need to be able to represent people beyond the scope of themself, have either had slightly different experiences or largely different experiences.Especially in terms of senators and the president, who have to represent large groups of people rather than just one rural community. And we think this is inherently bad. Because if politicians believe voters could only ... If voters believe that politicians can only support those who have identical experiences with them, this will decrease their faith in the government structure as a whole. They will have less faith that government can actually represent them if they don't see a candidate who is directly in line with their experiences, their emotions, their ideals.And if they have less focus, if they don't see candidates that can represent them and they see that, there'll be less voter turnout, there'll be just overall a falling down of government and ...

1321,"So I think probably the main question in the debate should be, who should voters vote for? Someone who cares about an issue more, or someone who a legitimate well mechanized plan to solve the problem? I think it's vote for someone who cares about the issue more. You will get someone who's very passionate in office, but that still leaves the problem still exists. I would rather have someone who might have slightly less passion, but have an actual way to fix the problem. Because we can agree on both sides of the house, and in all politicians that there are problems that exist in the world. And we would rather have someone in the office that can fix the problems, rather than just talk around the problem and relate to the problem. We think the goal of this should be have put people into office who could actually fix the problems. And you get this in our side of the house, because political debate is unique opportunity to compare candidates side by side. If you value mechanization you can see, okay, they proposed we do this, this and this, which will result in fixing this structural barrier. They just talk about this a lot and don't actually propose how we fix it. So by the end of their term in office, this structural barrier will still exist. Therefore, we should have ... The voters can see this is a clear solution that will solve the problem. And on this side, this is a not clear solution that will not solve the problem.
