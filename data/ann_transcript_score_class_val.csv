48,"So we just think that's something that just falls on So now I'm getting into our extension point years. So why is the federal government the most important actor and the best actor to prevent the infringement of religious Liberty? So the federal government is the best actor to change this because while there do exist state and provincial differences in values, there are the ultimate guards of the constitution of the state and thus have the right to remove funding from dissident States.

They have the right to impose the general civil liberties that are given by the constitution of the state that is accepted by all the members of that state, and therefore absolutely have the right to refuse giving funding, state funding to some national States that do not align with the federal protected liberties of a certain state. So why this action on the part of the federal government will be the most effective in preventing infringement on religious liberties. We think that sub-national governments cannot operate without federal funding in the federal state. And therefore when the federal government misjudges on what is not allowed in the infringement of our religious beliefs, they are the best actor to do so. They are the best actor to ensure that civil liberties are protected when it comes to especially religious identities.

So there is a long standing understanding that the state should not assert themselves in affairs and personal beliefs, such as religious beliefs. And by the federal government suspending funding, they are able to assure that States are not asserting themselves in affairs that do not belong to the state. So it's a longstanding agreement between the state and its citizens that it doesn't meddle in the... Assert itself in personal affairs and by a state saying that they have the right to infringe upon religious liberties of particularly minority religions with the state, then that's accepting that state power can go beyond the scope of what is given by the citizens that allow it to operate.

Right? And so what Anish proposed was going after the politicians who are responsible for these laws cause politicians our book go on to propose them and get them through what will happen when we target these politicians, right?

Why harm them? We are wanting specifically to target those who are oppressive so that they can reform and that's where we do that. No, and then so now we're going to move on in the last minute and a half to are like, just to recap our contentions, right? So we already talked about the first one.

1528,"children more able to succeed more fulfilling that parental responsibilities. Let's get right into that, right? So what do children need to succeed? So I'll be telling you the critical piece of success in either sense of the word, like I kind of talked about at the top, is the belief that it comes from this sort of internal motivation, right? A belief in oneself that isn't actually shaken by failure, drawbacks. Sometimes things happen to all of us, just being people in the world, right? Internal motivation is essential because it's unwavering. It's not contingent on circumstance. It can withstand kind of things that happen to you that are negative, right? Obviously there will always be failure and things to deal with, particularly in the pursuit of one's goals, right? You're never just continually progressing towards something, there will always be drawbacks, and having belief within yourself that isn't impacted by those goals and fundamentally shaken allow you to actually kind of move forward with those things, right? It's also not contingent on other people and their motivations, right? I think parents are sort of unique in that they're really the only objective with you as a child just help you the best they possibly can, right? They're often, especially from your perception as this child, that's kind of all you see them as doing right. They're here to support and love you, right?  So lots of other people, other kind of external motivation children may get throughout their life. It's also often more difficult to see why they're giving you praise, right? Do they have their own motives, their own sort of circumstances as to why that's happening and so it's less sort of a meaningful, valuable thing that they were taken to impact your identity when you have that extra motivation. So essentially there's a lot of ways in which internal motivation it's kind of the only thing that could provide a solid belief in oneself. You should continue to do the thing, even if there are sort of, drawbacks and things that, not take that within yourself, right? So internal belief in oneself and one's goals is an essential piece of success because it gives you something to continually strive for. For you to keep going, working towards, right?

1529,"So when it's critical at this particular juncture to then impress upon them that, ""Yes, you are a special person, you have individual value,"" and therefore kind of like grow that internal motivation but then that I talked about, right? Also important to understand, that children haven't actually really had to face a lot of failure yet, right? Generally their lives are like pretty straight forward. There aren't major sort of obstacles standing in their way. There's a chance they can kind of build themselves up and it's a critical sense, but then when they go into the world and they no longer have the sort of constant reassurance with their parents, they have this fundamental belief in themselves that allows them to weather those other obstacles.  So why does this mean children are more likely to succeed, right? So come back to this idea of the two forms of success. So why being valid in your identity, feeling like you're a unique individual is an inherent form of success, we think, right? Just generally feeling like you have a purpose as a human. There's some reason why you're not just like another face in the crowd. There's not just the meaningless void. You as an individual have some sort of value, right? I think that's a form of success and this motion obviously inherently kind of proves that, right? You have a reason to believe that actually you have a purpose and a meaning as a person and we've already achieved that kind of success on our side of the house. And then secondly there's actually achieving your goals, right? If you like art as a kid, you're like, ""I want to be famous painter, I'm going to become a famous painter,"" So we think this is where that internal motivation is so critical, right? Because it allows you to push through the obstacles or the failures that you experience on your way to achieving those goals. It allows you to actually feel like they're worth achieving, right? That there's a way in which you can succeed in achieving those goals, even if you don't make it all the way to the very end point to those goals, you actually have a reason to continue to pursue them because of that internal belief.",constructive2,5.0,ejones,round6,ejones_round6,0.0,75.0

So even if opposition wants to say the most important thing is helping children achieve their goals in a sort of more concrete sense, like the point of life is being successful in terms of your career or your objective, those kinds of things. I think the critical thing you need to make that happen is a reason to push through those things even when they're difficult a reason to believe that you actually can overcome the situations that sometimes, in the moment, seem impossible to face, right? That you're uniquely able to manage those situations when you have an actual belief within yourself that can only come from your parents in your childhood, that you actually can do the thing, right? Without that motivation you will always be inclined to shy away from those failures, shy away from those obstacles, and you'll never be able to sort of fully self actualized in that way being able to achieve those objectives. So regardless of which sort of version of success you want to prioritize in this debate, I think clearly on opening government we've shown you the best way to get those, is to tell children they have unique values individuals. That in and of itself is already a success and it allows them to push through the kind of complicated obstacles they'll face in their life on their way to achieving their goals, this is what allows them to do that.",constructive3,3.0,ejones,round6,ejones_round6,0.0,75.0

Second, there's public pressure from the government who is trying to solve the housing crisis. And third, because like they said, they're going to be concerned about this tax if it's true, that if this counts personal housing because we don't know if that's true. But if that's true and if they live in that, then they would rather be able to use the same amount of land to get multiple payouts from multiple people renting and therefore, they'll likely want to build the multi-family homes which solves their issue on raising rent as well as it increases our link for why we are likely to get multi-family homes in the future.",constructive1,,mstonem,round1,mstonem_round1,0.0,76.0

He barely won the last election and he's been embroiled in a number of corruption scandals. We tell you that even though often the narrative and maybe the narrative including Netanyahu wants to shore up the support by being militarily active. Here's the problem with this is that the Israeli people don't want to be militarily active. In so far as that poses a direct risk for them. In so far as Netanyahu is already politically unpopular in the status quo. If you see it as a strong man taking incredible risks, he's likely to just lose the next election because the Israeli people just don't care about Syria all that much.

Russia took that and leverage is a wave, but last, few would say that the United States is decreasingly supportive to Israel. AIPAC is poisonous and most of the democratic party runners actually support decreasing military aid to Israel. So it's decreasing the importance in the status quo that the United States supports Israel. Here's why. Even if the United States attacks, it's still okay for you as Russia. 1. You flex your muscles to the degree that you now have way more legitimacy in the region to your allies, so you have way more allies than just Israel or the United States, whatever. You secure Iran. Second of all, as I said, Iran will never make a deal with the United States, which means that you have a longterm supply of oil, which is the foundation of your economy. We are the only side that impacts that is way more important than whether America's pissed off or not. Then, we would say even if the attacks are going to happen and they're relatively bad in the short run. It's probably going to be okay in the long run.

It's really unlikely that the United States and gets involved in the ground and great power war between the United States and Russia. Its likely to be short term airspace, that are just temporary. That means you can probably start with that. The short term video views a little bit of economic output, but if you secure economic interdependence with Iran in the long run, that's way more beneficial to you, given that the United States would probably have to be training with you anyways.

1500,"the greatest scientific and artistic developments throughout history have been from special people, people who are able to take disciplines that are usually not matched together and have been able to mix them together. Now what do I mean by this? Let's take an example like, I don't know, artists who come from the LGBT community. By taking their ability to succeed as artists, the skill that they have developed, and mixing it with their personal identity, they are able to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts, an artistic piece that is unique. And so that is an example of how telling kids how they're special, and trying to find the different ways in which their personal identity intersect, to create something which no one else could create, could lead to something like artistic development. Because someone may be able to create a great piece of LGBT art, but if they lack interest in a wide variety of fields they might create something specific to themselves. Something that a kid from a white community creates for LGBT art will always be different from something a Black kid creates and so on. And another thing that should be kept in mind is the idea that the current human mindset is not equipped to deal with our current technological age. Now what do I mean by this? We currently live in a society in which it is very easy to access people being very good at a specific individual field. You can always go on the internet and find some five-ear-old who can play piano better than you ever will, some 14-year-old who draws incredible art. And so at the beginning this makes it very demotivating for kids who live in our current society, in which they are based upon conventional measures. Instead, what parents should focus on is teaching kids to try and find ways in which they can create products, or create view points, which might be different from those of just hyper-talented people. In which they can bring their multi-faceted life experiences, their family experience, their geography and so on, to be able to create something that though may not be good on a technical level, is at least unique and able to speak to people in different ways.

1546,"the table in terms of argument. We say that there are multiple problems with not removing funding for these types of faults. First of all, we think that the removal of funding as a punitive measure is the strongest way by which governments can set precedence against violating federal laws. We think that setting this precedent is extremely important because in many cases you need top down national chains. In countries with federal systems, we give the example of Brown V Board of Education where there are many states that were willing to violate federal laws or were would have been resistance to changes in federal laws. Sorry, not at this time. And where begins in federal laws, but the change needed to come from top down because of a national movement against it. And as a result of this, we think that there was a need for a precedent of actual mechanisms by which states are forced to do things that a federal government, we think this also solved for any like edge cases of theocracies having state things because we think if there are sort of things going against existing theocratic issues in countries and the religious liberties their life, we think that these types of national movements in far as they happen will need top down change in the same way and therefore, we'll need mechanisms and precedents set by which state governments get changed by the federal instruments.  Sure. Yeah. Okay. When I know we're going over for Brown V Board of Education to happen, the North had to integrate in order to force the south to integrate. For marijuana, for example. Lots of states are against federal law. How it can be the case that federal law should always be enforced when there's no way for federal law to change unless you bought the state's experiments and come up with new, better ways to hit any laws. So first I would say that we use this as an example for when it's necessary for federal laws to force states to do something not as an example for when states doing things are actually good cause they need to be test beds for this, cause we don't think it's the case that we need test beds for religious discretion.

1247,"So now let's go to why the ideal political debate happens on our side. Why do emotional appeals obfuscate the responsibility of the political system and what is politically right? Why? Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.",constructive1,,djasson,round3,djasson_round3,0.0,76.0

Needing to produce the best result, you need to pull together the most local information and how a reasoning that can be weighed and your emotional bandwidth is limited. So therefore, even if you can empathize with everyone, you can't keep up and emotional aspects of debate wear off far quicker than logical reasoning. We think fragmentation of experience means that emotions go both ways. That means again, if you feel very strongly about marginalized people in your country emotionally, well someone can feel the exact same way and the other way and it's a wash. We think that fragmentation of experience is also why there's not enough action on issues like gun control or climate change because everyone has only small experiences that don't pull together to the big picture, that only data and reasoning can explain.",constructive2,,djasson,round3,djasson_round3,0.0,76.0
1488,"kind of values are you actually instilling in these children? I still think that the conception we get from Corey is relatively low burden when he's like, ""Oh well we can still instill some values and let them know that they can achieve everything they want in some aspects."" But also not. So I think that for him to call us low burden and then pull some shit like that, it's a little bit stupid, but whatever, it's fine.

I'm going to talk about [crosstalk 00:01:09] individuality. No alright. So, I would say that the actual scenario, if you're not teaching children that they're special and that they have the means through which to achieve things that they want to achieve, what then are you teaching them? I would say it's either A, nothing. That means that you let the child learn what the world is like on their own. Right? Why is this bad? Because it's more likely that they're going to be beaten down defeated by structures that they're not themselves aware of. Right? But it also leads to a level of conformity when they realize that the only way in which they can succeed over time is to blend in with overall society and instead of focusing on individuality and why themselves, they might be better, they will emulate others instead. Which we tell you is inherently more fun. But, I think the second and probably more likely option because that what Corey's characterized to you, it's the parent directly teaching the child that they aren't special and that there might be specific structural barriers that inhibit their ability to succeed longterm. Right? Why do I think this is bad to teach specifically at an early age. Right? Because I think what this does is create a defeatist mentality right from the beginning, that systems are stacked against you and you don't necessarily have the means through which to actually solve those problems and to overcome those barriers. We tell you that at the very least, telling a child that they are special right from an early age, instills a large amount of confidence in them. Whether or not this confidence is misplaced, we tell you, doesn't actually matter, because you can be stupid yet competent and still do really well in society

",constructive1,4.0,jaketsullivan,round6,jaketsullivan_round6,0.0,76.0
1489,". So yeah, why is conformity worse as well? Right? Because I think that that's the alternative world here. Because they're all people that are worried about the structural barriers will realize that they have to opt into this society in order to be successful. Conformity is worse for a couple of reasons. One, you settle for less and two, you don't strive for more. Right? I think that that's the unique impact you get from [Lynn's 00:04:02] extension on our side of the house. A, when you are instilling that confidence at an early age and B, all the impacts we told you about what specifically parenting gets better, hasn't been largely taken down by, Oh, like [Opech 00:04:13] at all. Like really they tried to co-op our parent benefit. But let me explain this a little bit more to you-... and tell you why it's [Nuance 00:04:18] analysis doing this All right, so when you are a parent, and you tell your child over and over and over again that they are special individuals, you as a parent are going to subconsciously develop that expectation or that view of your child as special. What does that mean? Right? That means that it creates this perpetual cycle where because you believe your child is special, you are more likely to divert more resources and invest more into their nurture and their care and their wellbeing because you yourself view that as special. Right? So what this means and what Lynn just told you here specifically about parents as actors, is that when parents are more incentivized to increase basically resources poured into their child, it means that whether or not that child was special to begin with, that child is going to be better off than children that don't have that level of attention invested into them because they have more resources. Because later on they're going to have a leg up over other people. ",constructive2,4.0,jaketsullivan,round6,jaketsullivan_round6,0.0,76.0
645,"like policy that you can get enacted. They're saying, ""Look, we are doing good things for you because we argue. Here's my story."" The issue with that is that it's not focusing on the ways that you get support for these people. You see it's far superior when we focus on objective truths, not on things. We also say that it's far easier for an idealogue to take power rather than someone who deserves to be in power. Why is this the case? Because they're far better at using things like political rhetoric or attack narratives to say, ""Listen, they don't understand you people. I understand you."" Without actually getting to anything of subjectivity. That means the things like cults of personality based around centers, individual people, not an actual tangible evidence. We see that that's far worse on their side of the house. Why is this the case? You probably get rise in people who are able to get on TV and convince people of massive things without getting tangible change. That means the people that aren't necessarily speakers, which in the status quo and patriarchal societies are women, don't get the opportunity to be able to share their narrative because of the way they've been excluded by society, all right? A man isn't going to vote for a woman if they're not being seen and being relatable. That's a massive issue with the equality. If you can't get access to power, you're not going to be able to do that. They fail to show you on their side of the house that you get any solvency. All right. And also the nature of emotional appeals makes it incredibly hard to critique. How are you supposed to tell someone that their personal story is false? That means if Ben Shapiro is out there saying his far right shit about how people are targeting white Americans and how that's an issue, then you can't say that's not necessarily true because people understand that and relate to that. It's a personal story, and it becomes a lot more and it becomes a lot harder if you're not basing it on facts, you're solely basing it on the persuasiveness of the argument and how people feel.

This is a very personal thing, and you don't want to put it out in public. The nature of the political discourse is that it becomes very public. We see it's far superior to not focus on things like your marriage life, more likely to focus on things like your overall benefits you can have to society than doing that. Why? Because often times your personal story is too hard to share. You're not going to want to share your personal story because you've got massive trauma associated to it. I don't know. Christine Blasey Ford is a massive exception. Women who've shared experiences like massive sexual trauma aren't going to want to share their personal stories.

What do I mean by this? I mean that federal funding isn't just something we're giving them for free. It is a transaction and that we are giving, the federal government's giving them funding because they are listening to the constitution. They're agreeing to this political contract. Why is it so important? Is that this whole idea of transactionality, is actually how we protect most minorities and this is how we take it over our opening half. Is that they want to focus on religious minorities. We are giving you that transactional nature of federal funding is the actual way that the federal government protects most minorities. Again, look at segregation. When the federal gov, when the contract was broken and states were not integrating. The federal government with able to use the transactional nature of federal funding to say you broke the political contracts, I'm not giving you funding and therefore I'm going to protect minorities. That's how we take it over our opening, by saying, we have to protect this whole idea of transactionality in nature because of how we protect any minorities in this household at all.

And the fact that we have, that like we are going to make it stipulated to the federal funding. This is a signaling effect that religious liberties is highly important at a D powers, the all right, the antisemitism, the Islamophobe. So how then does religious liberty laws violate both of these principles? First on transactionality you are no longer upholding your end of the bargain. You have broken the contract that we've agreed upon, when you pass religious liberty laws that violate the constitution. That is the same and so far as the constitution is a political contract that we've all agreed upon and you break it by passing anti-religious liberties, you lose the reason transaction, right? And since we have to uphold transactionality and that is how we protect all minorities, that is why we have to protect it. Secondly, in value consistency. We think this violates value consistency and the nature of federal funding and that it breaks. The reason that like it undermines the whole idea that value, that this is a value that should be consistent and is important across the entire nation. And in so far as that it's true.

Just listen to a second and more important extension. Why is this only available under a monotheistic system? First, I'm going to give you a characterization of what monotheistic does look like. I think opening government and closing government pretty much agrees that only under a polytheistic religion that can have both good and bad gods. Why is it then, that on monotheistic side, you only have the best, you only have the one perfect god? And why is this good? Firstly, this seems to be historically true. Under any sort of monotheistic religion, because people in that religion want their god to be seen as the best, they usually construct their god, or have a belief, or interpretation of that god, being perfect, having no flaws. But secondly, we think for these individuals, these religious individuals, god probably is the most important person to them. It is a sole reason of their existence. It is a sole reason why they do anything in life. This means that the construction of god on our side of the house is perfect, is someone that is flawless in every single way possible. Opening government and closing government then tries to tell you that this is bad, because this is unrelatable. Why is this not true? And why does this uniquely mean that people are able to better connect with god on our side of the house. No, thank you. Firstly, you have a common moral code, that every aspires to on our side of the house. Recognize that opening government and closing government tries to tell you there are benefits to having balance. But they never really show how that balance plays out in status quo. We think that's important, Well thank you, because simply asserting that there is a balance with different gods does not mean that people value each god the same amount. The reason why sexism is rampant in India is because obviously the male asymmetrically prioritized the god of sexism. I don't if that exists or not.

I think the point in which you have one perfect god, that god never makes mistakes, and evil happens, then people that follow that monotheistic religion get the message, ""God created us, God wants us to fix the problem."" This is a fundamental distinction you have from both sides of the house. On their side, they can justify the existence of evil by pointing at gods, without getting any solvency, without getting any mechanisms because it is god who has created that evil. There are gods that represent evil on their side of the house. Compare it to our side of the house. When god, and the one god you believe in, believes that you, as and individual is perfect, that you can strive to become better, means that individuals on our side of the house are more likely to fight back to evil. Because the common moral code that people under a monotheistic religion lives under, means that they perfectly look up to the one single god, who is perfect, who is virtuous, who is forgiving, means that I want have those values as well. This means that people fundamentally act different in the face of evil on both sides of the house. This is unique, and we think this is something that is the most important. Much more important than any discussion you get on their side of the house. The fact that individual can have hope on our side of the house, not blame god, an entity that they cannot means that people always believe, and they always have hope on our side of the house. Recognize the characterization they give you on the evil, and the existence of evil gods, mean that individuals are hopeless, probably means that they are being condemned by that god, probably does not have any sort of hope, or any other alternative to find more meaning in life because it is an evil god that is condemning them.

Recognize the current trend is that U.S. allies are kind of lukewarm and becoming less enthusiastic in the region as a whole. Why is this the case? Firstly, just less of a decisive line against Israel, which Arab nations kind of don't like, right? And therefore they're increasingly frustrated with U.S. as an ally in the region. But secondly that Saudi Arabia often uses U.S. arms to harm their country as a whole, right? We think that they fund terrorist groups that go around and commit terrorist acts against these very nations, which they are very mad at us about because they're, the U.S. is funding arms to Saudi Arabia, right? We have to recognize that Israel is probably the only actor in the region who can unify both Shia and Sunni interests against a common enemy in this specific scenario. This means that by having a hard line against Israel, Russia has a chance now to buy out more allies, open the Shia faction and the Sunni faction in the Middle Eastern region. What does this tangibly look like? This means that more countries are likely to shift arms deals and oil trade deals and get more of those can get more of those deals with Russia rather than the U.S. It means to implement more diplomatic visits and ties where people actually support those visits and ties because they are increasingly a resentful of a U.S. relations with their country.

We think by saying, Assad has no one else to turn to, but the real reason why Russia loses Syria is because, once Syria has more tact and wants the region, it wants the countries more destabilized as a whole, this is the exact chance that previous rebel groups who seemed like they were going to lose the conflict now see a chance to actually go against the saw the Assad regime as a whole at the point in which infrastructure and military power is occupied to try and combat and defend against Israel is kind of aerial strikes. That's the window of opportunity that these rebel groups look for to actually destabilize a region and come back alive.

Intervention does happen. It means that they've can massively increase military presence in the region and possibly occupied neighboring countries from Syria. If intervention doesn't happen, it still means that Russia could deploy more military in the region, portraying Israel as a threat. Notice the nuance here.

And Singapore had been mentioned a lot throughout this debate. I think that our mechanism that we had previously been stated so eloquently, by my partner, is the idea that we want a gradual introduction of this common currency, within the ASEAN countries, which will allow a more organic, transition, from this old, divided currency, into a more common currency. This is important because countries like Singapore, and because that hard punch and a larger economic stance, do, and will realize that they may be at, in the short term, an economic disadvantage. But, in a positive light, by having this, they will understand that there is longterm benefits, because of the fact that this will be transitioned organically and will not be a complete cutoff, which will allow the longterm benefits such as... Okay, so my idea, my point here is that I'm saying, is that, when you have these countries who are larger in economic status, dealing with smaller countries, what it is, is it creates this idea of a big fish in a small pond. You have this theory that these countries like Singapore, although they may be economically secure to the other countries in their unification, what that does is, is it allows these smaller countries to A. Be able to piggyback off of these larger countries in that op, get that economic aid and economic support, which my partner had mentioned, which is positively beneficial to them, thus increasing their economic status, which will in turn help Singapore in the first place.",constructive2,4.0,squeeze,round4,squeeze_round4,0.0,72.0

They're going to be more of a role model, have more say, and be able to be more involved in the whole process.

656,"To go into my positive material, emotion and subjective experience prevent your message from being listened to. We see this with movements like Occupy Wall Street. There's a movement in 2008 as a result of the financial collapse and the recession because of the corruption and deregulation of Wall Street that allowed the financial crash to happen. This is a protest movement where everyone rallied in the streets and they had drum circles going all day for weeks. There were people out camping. It was a huge protest movement, but it was ultimately unsuccessful because they failed to push their movement outside of the realm of emotion because people were hurt. People felt hurt because of the financial collapse, but they didn't bring any substantive policy change, and so nothing happened. They relied too much on how the collapse made them feel rather than what they were going to do about it. So it resulted in basically only drumming and riots and a general distaste and anger towards the system that they were trying to protest. We also see this with commentators like Ben Shapiro who make their careers off of quote, ""Dunking on liberal snowflakes."" These people use the emotions of their opponents, they cherry pick the people who are most emotional, who have the most emotional response to whatever he says. He makes them look like fools because their argumentation isn't there, and then he profits off of that even though he doesn't have to do any of the work.

But these people, like in what Occupy Wall Street did not organize around that, they instead focused on the lifestyle changes they wanted to make and the anecdotal feelings of the members of the movement and how they felt towards the government that was oppressing them. So when you had those protests that were televised and the police brutality that happened, the movement was so focused on emotion and so unrelatable to most people in middle America who were seeing them on TV. A lot of people who couldn't relate to that movement because they didn't understand the argumentation rather than the points that they were trying to make. A lot of the people who saw that movement rallied for the cops, they enjoyed watching the hippies there get beat up and pepper sprayed and everything because they thought that it was just a bunch of emotional people who didn't want to fight for their country, who weren't patriotic or anything. They thought they were just people who were guided by emotion and not by reasoning. So we see that these people were not able to get their message across because of the emotion that so eclipsed their points. A lot of times movements based on emotion rather than substance and policy ideas push people away and render themselves moot by not clarifying what they actually believe in, what they actually want to have done.

Whereas in the past they weren't seen this way. We think this increases their prestige on the global station makes them seem more stable as a block that is interdependent and tied together in a way that they were not before. We think that previously investments and political capital only lend to the up-and-coming countries. But now we think these are tied together, these kind of collective prestige that you didn't see before. So why did we think there's no incentive in status quo for outside nations and also regional nations to actually invest in these worse off countries? We think that investments are really important to revitalize economies, reduce poverty, increase leverage for political benefit and for even leveraging this against human rights abuses or government abuses occurring within these nations. We think that previously these kind of incentives literally did not exist. But in the status quo we create a world in which we a united currency we create an currency, you create a stable block that isn't encountered to China.

If they provide me capital, I'm probably going to like them more. There's things that China thinks, the investment for trying to develop itself, is being able to engage in these countries so it's going to want to interest the things. So then these countries developing on their own goes directly against China's core interests. Why is this true or what happens then? How is this true? Because when they developed on their own in their bubble, because what the government's argument basically for, is that by making this collective group they're going to have more inter trade between these states and they're going to be able to engage less with China. Why is this a net harm? [crosstalk 00:03:44] When they engage less with China, here's three key, practical impacts that are going to be very important. First, when China's going to take punitive actions because this is happening, what does this look like? This means getting capital for any sort of future investment becomes incredibly hard. Why is this true? The mass of capital in Asia is located within Chinese investment banks. Although I think there are some economic powerful countries, a lot of people, individuals first, and States, go to Chinese investment banks to get capital to finance countless projects. This means that China maintains ownership over these two, a lot of state owned enterprises. This means that China just purposely will hike up the interest rates, that these, on the loans that they are offered to these countries, making capital a lot harder for them to access. Second of all, they're going to stop helping these countries develop their infrastructure. They're going to be a lot less willing to offer BRI initiatives to these countries, which these countries immediately are disadvantaged because that means that the rest of the Asian, like West, Eastern Europe and West in Asia, are going to be developing while they're being left out because Asia's like okay, we're going through exclude you out of that belt and road initiative, sorry you chose to take your path and work with the United States.",constructive1,,bfalkofs,round4,bfalkofs_round4,0.0,75.0

The countries like Singapore still benefit the most in this motion. That's not true, because when China is going to then engage in things like trade wars with the powerful countries and a CO. This means that then China is going to hike up its tariffs on things, or make trading with these countries, I meant, a lot more difficult. It is going to make them harder too for those countries to prosper. So then leave him alone? No. So let me just kind of back up, explain to you like why is China going to be upset? There's two things. First, the ideological method, this is what I talked about in my rebuttal, how now that China's going to see this is a collective happening in Southeastern Asia as the literal tangible thing that Western ideologies created.

That means these lenders have to go to China. It is just that those going to China are going to be immediately screwed over average. It makes increasing the problem a lot harder.

944,"So moving on to the argument, why do we believe people on the lower financial spectrum are more likely to be disenfranchised? First understand under the middle class, from the very beginning, we already characterized to how oftentimes the only tangible assets of these people own are property. Oftentimes liquid cash is simply harder to attain because oftentimes liquid cash is going away in a lot of daily expenditures and things like that. So the conclusion is at the end of the day, under their world, it's often difficult for these individuals to pay the tax to begin with. Second, we believe if this motion is passed, it will create an even more imbalance within home ownership",constructive1,,jumzthewarrior,round1,jumzthewarrior_round1,0.0,75.0
945,"We believe first, it removes the incentive for a large group of people to ever go up the social ladder and buy property to begin with. Because oftentimes the fact that punitive taxing is extremely scary for a lot of families and a lot of individuals, meaning a lot of families who are within the middle class or even lower middle class, so a spectrum, know they are going to be unable to pay these taxes to begin with. So the incentive structure for them to ever buy property and ever have financial stability through that property is lost and we believe that's extremely dangerous for these families,",constructive1,,jumzthewarrior,round1,jumzthewarrior_round1,0.0,75.0
946,"Third, why believe, why do we believe that it's extremely harder for renters as well? Because understand, as I've already told you, that oftentimes the cost of the taxes, the taxation costs trickles down to renters, but oftentimes it was also important to recognize that individuals or families who still want to buy property are now going to have to choose mortgages, meaning that this cost is going to. We already know how the cycle of mortgages is often very dangerous for individuals because they get caught up in a cycle of loans and they're unable to pay back, meaning that even if they go for a loan, they're probably at a risk of losing their property at the end of the day.",constructive1,,jumzthewarrior,round1,jumzthewarrior_round1,0.0,75.0

We believe at the end of the day, richer individuals will still own property regardless. And why is that the case? One, they can simply afford to buy, so. Second, they can often afford to pay the taxes as well. So at the end of the day, the harms of do trickle down to the individuals who are at the lower end of the spectrum. But if this imbalance occurs while the individuals are now going to have complete control of prices of housing, this is extremely detrimental because then they're only going to rent out their housing at prices that is palatable to either richer individuals or upper middle class individuals, meaning people in the middle and people in the lower spectrum are now unable to one buy these property, this property as well. B, rent it out as well.

1502,"So the first point is this, the relationship between parent and child. I think that this relationship looks like this. Parents have an obligation to give their children the best supporting to be successful in society. This means that parents need to make actions that are going to put their child's interest at first. I think this is where the first clash of how this has come to be the status quo. I think in the status quo, parents are kind of torn if they should be realistic or be honest with their child. If they know their child lives in an impoverished area and probably can't ask the same resources that a white child could in a very nice neighborhood, they might not want to set you up for disappointment. The thing is I think that's not true because I think at that point that the parents are limiting, because they are limiting some of the child's agency. Because the way that the parents socialize their children, the decisions they make, right? This means that if a parent decides that the child can only amount to so much, the message you that give to them is going to equal access, right? This means that if a parent makes this snap decision when they're raising a child, that the child is not going to be able to achieve much because of the area they live in, or the context they're growing up in. It means that the parents want to offer, like provide messaging, that the child's going to then grow up understanding that they probably can't achieve as much, right? I think that that's harmful and that when we shift this on the comparative to look more like a world in which parents are saying, ""No, you are special, you should you do whatever,"" it changes. It's no longer taking away that child's choice so that they're really able to choose things or not. ",constructive1,3.0,bfalkofs,round6,bfalkofs_round6,0.0,75.0

There's always the skill of continual growth that we want to do, and I think a lot of this comes into how you were socialized as a child. If you are taught from early on that, ""No, you have been screwed over, the birth lottery fucked you over, you're not going to be able to get much out of life,"" you're not going to aspire to much. There's people who are going to probably just like, ""Okay, I got dealt a really bad hand, I'm going to make the best of it and live in poverty,"" not live in poverty, but live like they'd just not fight for better. I think this is the second point, right? What is the effects of positive signaling do to a child, right? And I think that the effects of positive signaling is really just getting a child to the point of which they don't want to accept what they're given. I think that children should not be taught to accept that what they haven't been able to see immediately, that's an option for them. Instead by saying, ""No, every child inherently special,"" it probably puts more of an emphasis on them, right? Let's use an example. Like what if I was growing up and my parents told me I was special. And I get to that first point of conflict where I'm finally like, ""Wait, am I not special?"" I think this is a really important moment in a child life now in our new counterfactual, where I think we see the most growth that's opposition can't handle, they don't get this. I think they're like, when I get to this point of where I'd have to show up, I think I fight for it more because I have been socialized to believe that I deserve this. If I deserve it I'm going to fight a hell of a lot harder than if I wasn't taught that I deserve this, right? It's kind of like playing on the human psyche.

619,"So first on the extension of our definition of objectivity. We think that objectivity means connecting subjective experiences together. We think that every experience is necessarily subjective, because only one person cannot experience someone else's life. So every experience is subjective. But what it means for something to be objective is if many people have experienced the same phenomenon. So for example, even if my experience of of police being racist to me is a subjective experience, if millions of other people have experienced the same thing, then we can think police brutality is an objective phenomenon in America. So that's what objectivity means for us. So then that definition sort of takes up all these arguments made in the GW about how their responses to for example. They say that people like MLK were portrayed as crazy. We think that even if there's some strategization of MLK as being crazy or too violent, we think that the fact that the millions of black people or white people banded together and supported MLK, that proves that MLK's movement was actually an objective movement, which means that their responses do not apply or do interact with others.",constructive1,,meganwu,round3,meganwu_round3,0.0,75.0
620,"That's why we think it's more likely that anger is going to be co-opted by elites, rather than it's going to be used by activists, which is a reason why we should prefer objective approaches to policy, such as data that thousands of people have experienced these things rather than, ""I am angry because I have experienced this."" We think that the methodologic difference between those two things means that it's more likely that people with agenda setting power will take advantage of emotions and use it as a means to discredit people. The second reason why we think that it's more likely that elites will co-opt anger than activists will use anger to mobilize it is that there's a bunch of examples out there and ones that we have given you about how in the past, subjectivity has been used to discredit valid and good positions. For example, climate change deniers look at the same facts as everyone else, but then manipulate those facts into the interest of the elite, which are oil corporations with large money and a lot of agenda setting power. We think that's an example of how subjectivity is used to create terrible political and it's been mobilized by elites. The flip side of this is that even when there's a group of people who are super angry but don't have any direction to direct their anger in. People like Trump or populists are able to take that anger and direct it towards a terrible cause like the immigrants from this country. The last example that I'll bring up is how British colonizers in India created the modern day cast system by turning people against each other in order to create conflict between classes. This is an example of how subjective experiences were mobilized to benefit the interest of the elite, which is why we think that objectivity is better. Now, the last comparative between the probability of elites co-opting anger and the probability of activists using anger to mobilize is this that, if it's the case that elites are going to discredit activist movements, we think that it's better for activist movements to change their strategies, rather than just to feed into what elites want them to do.",constructive2,,meganwu,round3,meganwu_round3,0.0,75.0
658,"same thing. We have different ideas of what we want and we have different ideas of how we're going to get there. So this is not something that's objected. This is in its nature a subjective field. So by ignoring the fact that politics... what we see right now or in the situation where there is no subjective experiences brought into the thing where we only have hard facts, you're ignoring the fact of why people want what they want, which is extremely important in political discourse. We can't just be talking hard numbers all the time. We have to have a reason behind these numbers. The reality is that these numbers have stories and when you hear them you kind of have to fill in the gaps and you have nothing to fill in the gaps with. Subjective experiences allow us to get the full picture of what's really going on. So what happens in a world where we do allow subjective experiences into political discourse? So people are going to be able to understand the underlying principles behind which people base their opinions, which is very important. Not only in expressing your opinion but kind of making sure... I think right now we're in a country and now it's very politically divided. What happens is that people are not listening to why people want things. Which is a lot more impact... like saying it, ""I want universal health care, I want blah blah blah."" We have to talk about why we want that. Otherwise, it's completely irrelevant because it kind of just looks like throwing out facts which is exactly what you're doing. You need to give a reasoning behind your opinions and often that's not going to be factually based. It's going to be based on a different lived experiences of every single person. Everyone's going to have a different experience whether it's socioeconomically, racially, everyone going to have a different perspective to bring in. By not listening to those facts, we actually limit political discourse because now people are not able to talk about the root cause of the problems, which is actually what we need to address by just talking about facts. We're kind of glossing over what's actually more important which is the deep reasons why these things happen.",constructive1,,mpoot,round3,mpoot_round3,0.0,76.0
659,"Then I also just want to talk about how bringing in subjective experiences is going to give us feedback on how these real world policies are working in life. So not just what are the policies so example, that I want to talk about. It's basically just policing so we can see through facts and figures where's being policed, who's being policed when they're being policed, but we don't know people's experiences with police and we've seen that that's actually a pretty negative thing, especially here. There's a lot of tensions between these people, but we don't know that if we're just looking at, ""Oh, they're policing this area more."" We need to get the actual story behind the figures. So what we see without this world where we bring subjective experience, we just see again numbers but this doesn't reflect the lived experience of people. At the end of the day, what we need to do is fill in the blanks with the gaps in our knowledge with the actual reality of the people who are living in these circumstances. What happens when you tend to bring in too much objective facts is it kind of glosses over a broad spectrum of people. We have to acknowledge that everyone is going to have a different experience and what happens with stats specifically and why I want to talk about stats, how they're not necessarily as effective is the stats tend to be, as we've seen, it's all about majority rules.

I think most of them think that this hurts like peer relationships in a sense that it makes them a lot less approachable if children think again that they have a predisposition to have a greater understanding of the world than their peers, but this is going to have distance though in the sense that they're always relating things back to their sense of self because they believe that their experiences are more valid than others, feel like that could apparently just damage pure relationships.

It's just something that has inherent value because a singular person can't know everything, can't have the perspective of a hundred different situations. Again, why do we care about this? As I explained earlier, as children grow up parents, I think they'll steer them of danger because if they're more understanding that their viewpoint isn't the only correct one, they understand that they are not special beings, that they also need other people in their lives. I feel like that means that they're more likely to not only to listen to advice but to also accept the advice they're getting from their parents about more issues that they might not understand, but additionally for this translates and appears specifically into issues with mental health.

Second, we think that you become a remarkably ungenerous person. That is, if you're the sort of person who believed from a very early age that you have deserved, that you deserve what you have gone, i.e that everything that you have gotten is because you are special and thus, you are entitled to that thing.

But somehow, on the other hand, it's still okay because you're told that you're not special by others so you get the both best of both worlds. No. What you get the worst of both worlds. That is, you learn that in order to be worthy, you have to be special. That becomes the way you determines whether you succeed. It is not, ""Have I worked hard?"" Or, ""Have I done pretty well?"" But, ""Am I a special person? Is there something inherent in me that deserves to be lauded?"" What happens then, is that you think that, one, that is the standard you hold yourself to, that you have to be special and second you breathe, you aren't. That is, all parents do is set up the standard for what you have to meet and don't help you meet it. The result is, you think that you have to be special to be worthy. And you aren't, because sometimes you will inevitably fail. The result is that, people do not learn from those failures. Instead of learning from those failures, they lash out when they get negative feedback that contradicts their self image. This is really bad, because it means that you get less hard work. That is, they say that you feel like a disappointment. We think that disappointment motivates you to work harder in a world where you say that that disappointment isn't inherent to your being. If you fail, and you haven't bought into the idea that you are special, where the failure is evidence that you are fundamentally unworthy, and I think that makes you feel much, much better.",constructive3,4.0,poconnor,round6,poconnor_round6,1.0,82.0

And why is that specifically important? How we'll link that key to importance in the education system? And it's not like they're treating their kids like customers. It's like they will have more resources and a better know how of how to cater to specific types of children if they're more of those types of children going to these schools.

Because I feel like the reason why these children will end up going to college, and especially in developing countries, and here's where I talk about that very distinction, is because most of them don't really receive primary education. This isn't like a family education wasn't good enough. It's because these countries actually lack properly developed primary education system.

So you have richer or middle class people that end up going to private schools that are more funded, because it's funded by them, and not being able to access these public schools. Maybe like the son of a certain guy who dropped everything from the village in and moved to urban, put his child in a private school might be like the only anomaly or the only person that's succeeding under their model, because he was able to go to the university that his country was funding and then get a better job.

Even if that anomaly ends up going to college and becoming a doctor or a lawyer, the fact that their own country isn't able to provide higher social mobility for them, leads to them leaving their country, which leads to all the negative impacts they talked about anyways.

You are equal to these individuals; you are similar to them; we share in our common humanity and nothing about us makes us particularly special.

Note that OG frames this neutrally, but you'll definitely tell your kids that they're good and special in a profound way. No parent is going to opt in to say, ""You're unique because your eyebrows are very bushy,"" right? It'll be something else entirely. They're going to be super confident, right? The problem with this is you'll end up thinking that you are superior to others because your uniqueness manifests itself in a way that is most valuable to you instead of a way that is most valuable to others. We think that this is leading to A, things like decreases in empathy; because you relate to others less, because you view yourself as standing above them. We think that can lead to terrible antisocial behaviors or, at the very least, an internalization of hatred to others, particularly when they're young, for going beyond. We think that's problematic.",constructive3,4.0,noahmacdonald,round6,noahmacdonald_round6,1.0,78.0
1659,"Secondly, though, in terms of motivation, we think that we change the motivational nexus. We think if you think that you are intrinsically valuable, then that motivates you, not because you want to do more work, but because you think it's deserved to you. We think, therefor, that you are less likely to put in more copious amounts of effort. That if you knew that you had to work harder because you're starting at the same starting block as many people within your immediate socio-economic vicinity. We think that telling people that they are at the same place, at the very least, is going to motivate them to work harder, even if it's only within a limited socio-economic block within their peer group. If you think that you deserve more, I think you're going to put less work in. That's the problem of being egotistical. Secondly, our desserts, right? We think that when everyone wants to get what they deserve, they end up taking riskier behaviors. If you think that you are special and you deserve great things, and that you are special and you've got great talents, then you're more likely to behave in risky ways. We think that this causes social harms to others, particularly because, may we think prudently, investing your money in ... market tracking yield, market tracking funds instead of triple-letter GTFs as more likely to build up wealth, especially if you come from other socio-economic background. But, moreover than that, I think you are less likely to throw people under the bus in a dog-eat-dog world if you understand that everything is before basis, likely that we are all equal intrinsically, and that you're less likely to not be empathetic in a risky competition.",constructive4,3.0,noahmacdonald,round6,noahmacdonald_round6,1.0,78.0

First of all, I think that this creates immense psychological distress. If you end up in an average job with an average life, just the same as everyone else, I think that you either internalize that as you haven't lived up to your own goals, or you start blaming others and it becomes incredibly toxic. Then you're more likely to lash out your peers from a likely antisocial behavior. But, more importantly than that, we think that parents are an important act for this round.

We think this really matter from parents are telling their kids. We think parents have a lot of control over their kids' lives. Today's parents for the most part are like raising their kids or include active socialization. That is allowing the parents who control how kids think. We also think that kids necessarily look up to their parents who they see them as role models and things like that. We think therefore it's really important for parents to what's given to their kids.I think you'll see something like... The examples of some of these kids are really, take a long time to show that their parents are abusive. As they look up to their parents so much.

And we think with this sense of optimism that parents are able to instill in their kids, kids feel like they can overcome barriers. Right? Do you think that a parent for instance would tell a child that racism exists? But can tell them that they can overcome it.

We think this is especially true for minorities or low income kids who often might lack the confidence or feel the effects of the stereotype effects and other psychological biases that can keep them from succeeding when it really matters.

We think in the longterm that's all something that instead of kids, I'm turning more pessimistic looking down when they're able to see the long sort of arc of justice and are able to fight for what they believe in really important circumstances. We think this manifests itself and you're able to see this through like psychological studies that show the value of positive illusions and this sense of control we can get ultimately leads to longterm happiness for kids because they feel that they have control over their lives.

Because they believe that they have inherent self weapon are less likely to see themselves get paid up. Now let's quickly look at the counterfactual.

The counterfactual rate is just in the absence of confidence. We think that all of that things you get in society now still exist. You get things like bullying, you got things like racism, structural barriers. You also get mixed messages from society about what is good. And you have no way to fight back against them. Oftentimes when you try to get positive messages in high school or later, it's too late. These children are foreman and there is still plas...

1526,"see on TV. Do you think you're special because you have an iPhone 9? Wait until the next iPhone comes out, and the person who buys it is more special than you because their camera has three more pixels. The notion of specialness is one that is reinforced throughout society. It's one that you always have to adhere too and is an expectation that not everybody can achieve, but nobody can achieve. Because it inherently forces you to prove a negative. What is the harm of this? I think the harm of this is people can never properly appreciate their lives in the present. They never get a sense of mindfulness in which they evaluate the present as a good, but rather are always told to expect to compare that to some better possible future in which you get a one up on someone else and are therefore more special. I think this is also particularly important in the context of children, because I think children both biologically, culturally, geographically go through and wide variety of changing in life. You're different from the age of six to eight. A notion that is always forward looking means that children can't reflect on the wide variety of experiences they experience and will probably never experience again in the same way throughout their lives. So what is the... Given the harms of a hegemonic notion of specialness, what is the exceptional importance of an alternative analysis that parents provide that emphasizes, as opening opposition talked about, normalcy and your ability to be mindful and be happy with the present? No. Firstly, during childhood and teenage years. Given these pressures exist when children are young and formative, the ability for parents to provide an alternative analysis means there's a safe space for children in which children can do things like discuss their lives without expectations placed on them. The way... By the way, this rebuts everything Gov says. [Inaudible 00:05:22]. But, some people will be told they're special. The notion that you should be... The harm of someone being told special when some people aren't only occurs when there is an expectation that all people be special. If you're content with normalness that the notion of you being not special is by definition a nonsalient attack, right?  ",constructive1,5.0,jk2793,round6,jk2793_round6,1.0,82.0
1527,"Okay, so secondly. In adulthood how this narrative interacts.

Assuming opening government's framework in response to my POI that these values translate into adulthood, not embracing specialness allows people to have multiple conceptions of themselves that can occur at different points. That is to say, I don't think people should or do live their lives with a universal notion of who they are or what they are. The important thing to note is that given all the pressure they have to feel special, the fact that they have a well grounded familial notion that their parents provide of an acceptance of normalcy and being in the present means that there are multiple philosophical and analytical conceptions that children who become adults can use. Because I... People switch between different ways of thinking about themselves. This provides a strong basis to provide an alternative to the otherwise external pressures people feel to always feel special. You don't get a promotion, fine. It's good being normal.

1691,"So the first question, what's most likely to happen inside the opposition's world? There are two premises here that my partner presents to you, right? One, we think that society is inherently driven on competition, right? You are always going to need some sort of metric to be in place to determine like distribution of resources, allocate position of superiority. It's something that just happens naturally in our human beings as like an evolutionary survival instinct.",constructive1,3.0,kimevelyn37,round6,kimevelyn37_round6,1.0,77.0

We think that looks like privileged individuals, the elites within our society who have being the only ones that have achieved these metrics of success. They are the only ones that are determined to be special within our society, because they've had increased access to resources, increased privilege. Society always works in their favor, and they're the ones that get like CEO positions or high academic merits or something like that. Ultimately we think of the narrative of specialness is something that combats this and co-ops this is that we have a different metric, but everyone can be included in. We think that it is an all-encompassing metric that human beings and all interests can engage in, right? We think- ...not at this time. We think that I'm going to elaborate on this a little bit more when I talk about my second question. Let's move to there. About the positive impacts of being told that you're special, right? Because all up and down opposition bench, they tell you that it's like demoralizing if you failed after being told that you were the one that deserved it. We think that far more demoralizing when you're told that you're going to fail from the start or that you don't have inherent value or that you're never ever going to be able to fight against these structural disadvantages that prevents you from achieving success. That's the alternative that they ultimately advocate for on side opposition because what they're going to do is they're going to be leaning into this horrible system of structural disadvantages and encouraging complacency. This is the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy. If you don't have a positive narrative being told to you from childhood that you deserve success and that you are able to achieve it and ultimately what replaces it, is the idea of negativity and inferiority. This belief that you simply aren't capable of achieving that sort of success or change. We think that's extremely harmful. We need to tell kids that they deserve it even if they might fail, right?

1604,"First argument, characterizing Russia's interests. The first thing to know is Russia wants a stable Assad regime and they don't want excessive conflict in the region, particularly in terms of their allies because they want to consolidate power to an extent that oil markets are especially favorable to them and the allies and the region and they feel like they're a stable presence to be dealt with. But secondly on characterizing the conflict, we think that rebels that are being supported by the Israeli military are already starting to dwindle. We think that the free Syrian army, which is largely supported by Israel, is starting to capitulate in many instances, especially of them conceding to the Assad regime and trying to make deals out of that that would allow them to escape that region without being harmed further in the conflict. We also see the US diminishing its involvement in the region, especially as Russia, since you've established better ties with them since the advent of the Trump regime who is actively trying to pull out troops from the middle East as we've seen, especially in the case of Iraq in support for that conflict steadily declining. Given that the US is the number one giver and provider of aid to Israel, I think it's extremely important to consider them as an actor. And in its totality, we see that Assad is actually maintaining control over the region in such way that despite Israeli attacks on certain key areas in Assad's regime and in Syria in general, there is wide support for what he's doing currently, especially when you consider outside foreign actors like Iran, which are supporting these rebel movements as well. So no anti rebel room, sorry.",constructive1,4.0,gautierboyrie,round9,gautierboyrie_round9,1.0,
1605,"to these people, especially Iran and Syria. And he also wants to allow a degree of Russian presence in the region that makes it such the threat is great enough that it wouldn't be contested. But this was quite counter intuitive to these narratives, especially when you consider the fact that Russia is aware that it might not be able to control what the Assad regime does and it might not be able to control what Iran does because they are in some ways independent actors that could act and attack Israel in a way that he might not be able to control if it's even more violent. So at that point, the escalation of conflict is even more likely. But let's talk about the US because the US is at a unique tipping point in this debate where they have to grapple with the Trump administration that is, either supporting Russia tacitly or overwhelmingly support Israel under threat. The latter is significantly more likely given the presence of Israeli lobbyists in Washington, which is enormous, given the fact that Netanyahu, and Putin, and Trump have very close ties and they're ideologically more similar than anything else that we've seen with past US administrations. And given the fact that Israel is often a very touchy subject for Americans where they want to be able to support them given their interests in the region. Russia's threat means you've embolden the American electorate, you embolden the Trump administration to come in and try to support them further, which means at that point that that escalation of conflict is significantly more likely. The impact is that you get destabilization in the middle east in terms of what your interests are, specifically with regards to oil markets, specifically with regards to people challenging the consolidation of power that Assad is doing by slowly ticking away at the rebel groups that are being supported by Israel. You're able to take on some of the bombings that happened against Syria. You are able to provide aid and alleviate those things. But if it comes to the point where a super power like the United States gets involved, it's significantly more difficult for you to stop things like drone strikes, which the US is starting to decline and throwing down against Syria.",constructive2,4.0,gautierboyrie,round9,gautierboyrie_round9,1.0,

Even if escalation doesn't happen, why is it a terrible thing for the Russian regime to take First of all, if you do not follow through, it looks extremely bad on you and your allies for declaring that you're going to do something and in turn not doing it because it makes you questionable as a ally, not just in the middle east but in other countries, in other regions of the world as well.

We like to look at this as what's happening on stage, what's happening when people are discussing, this isn't side interviews, this isn't a blog posts, this is political debate and the most important thing with that is the largest, most well-consumed debate such as perhaps the democratic primary debate, which was largely televised and viewed by a lot more people than will probably actually turn out to vote in the primaries. What happens there is we have time that is short and people are talking about things that do not matter in the present day. They matter to them as a person and they may draw in more voters, but that doesn't display to the voters who they're voting for and who they're putting their support. I think the biggest example of this in the current day is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris when they had that huge blowout over what happened in the past. That is not who Joe Biden is today and yes, while Kamala's policies remain that way because that is her lived experience, she talked about what happened to her and not what she was going to do about it in the present, which yes allows people to see who they were, but now who they are or what they will do in office, which we believe is more important than anything else in this debate because it allows voters, even if it is a smaller, more knowledgeable population, to put people into office that they can actually trust and support.

1303,"We believe that patterns don't necessarily equal action, which is especially important when we apply this idea to all people. When we apply this idea of allowing the presentation of what's going on to be applied to both sides of the aisle. So when patterns don't equal action, we get people who lie about their personal experiences or whose emotions and opinions have changed and impacts their personal policy in the days of today and what's going to happen once they're in office. We don't want to idealize sympathy when it detracts from tangible change in the present day. When we look at this, we see that politics are more focused on people than policy. That is a worldwide trend that has begun to detract from the ability for political institutions to provide information on what is going to happen when we elect people. That's what happened in the 2016 election, and it's all personality politics now because we have so many candidates who would rather find their supporters through emotion than what's happening. What we see is the formation of political cliques, like the Yang Gang, because it's cool to join up even though I guarantee you the majority of his supporters don't know anything about his policy past his UBI. It's so important that we look at this debate as regret of the movement towards preferring the person and what they have experienced over the events that they will cause to happen in the present day. We do not get grip of the... We do not get the peripheral effect of a person hearing and understanding that policy if all that he was talking about what happened in the past. This creation of cliques realizes that we've lost focus on what happens when these people are elected.

That looks like kids, not just trying to pass their classes or achieve a passing grade but trying to achieve excellence, looking for other opportunities and believing that they can actually succeed in a number of ways.

You'd no longer believe that you are just the [crosstalk 00:03:32] forms when averaged, were achieved what the world tells you. It's not like normatively love-like acceptable life. You are seeking the best that you can because you believe you are powerful. I think that means that there's significantly more change, not only in terms of your individual life which leads to far more happiness, but also better societal change. I think that largely, people believing that they have something special within them means that they pursue every opportunity they can, to do good for the world. I think that leads to a better world more broadly because people are actually seeking change that they believe they are empowered to do. But secondly, no one tells you that you are far better at responding to failure. That's because, one, you still believe in yourself, right? Note that on their side, if you do not believe that you aren't special in any inherent way, when you fail at something, you are far more likely to take that empirical proof that you're bad. That means that when I go to my first debate tournament and 10, I'm far more likely to say, Oh, I'm probably a shit debater rather than, no, I know I have communication skills.

If they fail at that point they are locked into mediocrity for the rest of their life. They will never do anything meaningful for society.

But two, I think oftentimes people then compare themselves to communities that are inherently disadvantaged. That means that people look at themselves and say, Ah yes, my life will be like my parents. Locked out of post-secondary education. Perhaps not even graduating college or the high school, right?

598," Firstly, we say that subjective experiences often neglect to show whole pictures of problems and get to questions of solvency. So having an individual talk about how they were treated in a specific instance is incredibly useful to starting a conversation, but it isn't necessarily useful to solving it. So for example, it is a completely reasonable question to ask of like given that we have disparities in educational outcomes for women versus men, for example. It is unclear where in the educational process that happens or what stage we need to like combat it, which policies are the most effective in order to reduce discrimination. These are things that you can't get from an individual story. You need to look at a big picture. Because some people are affected differently in order to get a sense of which policies are the most effective at combating these things. In order to figure out which policies are actually going to be able to have the most change given limited resources you necessarily need look at science and data. I think that if you just listen to emotional appeal, you don't necessarily get whole big picture ideas for how to solve issues and things will be solved based on ... if politicians can get away with saying they're going to solve things by appealing to emotion. So for example, Justin Trudeau can say that he values the environment. He can go to the Environmental March and appeal to emotion by saying that he cares and then spend billions of dollars on a pipeline. You can appeal to emotion and not have policy.

But they're often divided by emotional ideologies. Let's say that you can only vote for people that have similar backgrounds to you. We would say this means that voter turnout is much lower when you have coalitions. For example, the democratic party in the United States where you're representing hundreds of completely diverse backgrounds where you can only represent one singular politician and they are almost certainly not going to build or represent everyone. When you have objective fact, you can see how these issues are related to each other on a broad scale.

We can see a useful way of conceptualizing throughout. You can think about our side is defending an academic model and their side is defending a political model. We said our side of the house gets much more nuanced policy. They made arguments about academia but I don't think they have made good reasons why academia is substantially better. The reason is that you get more nuance in-depth, and this is the analysis we want to bring to you.

637,"True. We'll do with this. Angie's arguments are remarkably un-comparative. Academia is not objective but is substantially more objective than subjective claims that exist in the policy in general. This is why things like for instance, Kimberly Crenshaw's claim intersectionality is not that 'I subjectively feel this to be true' but rather that there are indeed in the legal regime, existing pathways for instance where black people cannot get as great and cannot get as good but the unique social situation of black woman is not protected as a class- that is the inside of intersectionality, and that is the material fact that is not a subjective claim.
The same thing for instance with Richard Wallenstein demonstrated how the federal government segregated United States. It is not a subjective claim. It is a fact and that is how you get more policy that is better on our side of the house. Another example of this for instance is disrupting rectified power structures. For instance, where you understand federal colonialism as a fixture, as a structure rather than as an event that happened. We only get that by excavating the histories and relying on objective facts. So, on our side of the house, what we want to emphasize is that there is no way to communicate between subjective claims on their side of the house.
