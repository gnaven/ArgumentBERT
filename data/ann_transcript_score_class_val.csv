Rumor will tell you that minorities are these full often society and are systematically excluded and discriminated against. So when you start using hate speech, mainstream politicians are not going to be automatically. Let me talk about minority narratives. Let me talk about these ideas that they see themselves as fringe. What happens is those narratives just get more excluded because the subjectivity that people are most strong about is going to be this idea of the language that is more racist, more homophobic, and even if you do find their point, that there happens to be a greater impact of minority voices, the amount of hate speech that it incites from the other side of the amount of racism or homophobia or sexism, but then incite. Is it going to be more helpful? You're going to get politicians that are more likely to be populous, more likely to be Democrats that will lead from backslides of the democracy into authoritarianism. We tell you this is especially dangerous in countries where you don't have the same sort of free speech for hecklers and stuff. The language used mattered. You are able to talk and have discussions about what minorities think is important through policy decisions, not just focus on these pleased emotionality. Also, remember that when people focus on that subjective experience, they only focus on their subjective experience and not the subjective experience of others. They will be so stuck in the echo chambers that they won't even be able to see the other side. So let's talk about conservatives. Oftentimes we think they're angry and they miss the nuance of policy because they're stuck in their echo chamber as well. We also think moderates feel excluded when only talking about exclusion. We all know that there is a silent majority that doesn't get their voice heard because they feel that they don't fit into either of the echo chambers. So we get more sustained coalitions on our side of the house. Think about an issue like healthcare. A lot of the nuance about healthcare is not focused on the values of either side. From both sides, yell at each other, they bisque each other and go to any nuance of the situation.",jbotkin1,jbotkin1_round3

These people can overcome issues when they talk about objective issues themselves, rather than emotional appeals that exclude certain narratives and make people angry or when people are less angry, able to focus on policy, we think you are able to get better policy, more progressive policy passes. This is really important because it helps everyone in society. So for instance, if you have a country like the US passing healthcare reform, you don't get that if you have Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi yelling at each other. But you do get that if you have politicians that are able to focus on the new wants and represent the views of the silent majority by focusing on this idea of policy. Now let's also talk about the nature of political conversation. We think when people are able to see across the differences, they're able to find similarities and this results in the right turnout in the ballot box. We think you get issue oriented voters, right? You get money in political campaigns being spent on education of people about the issues rather than people fighting about political feuds themselves. We think this makes the voters more educated and the you get is not just like right-wing populace who have gotten really mad about something that was racist on Fox news for instance, or something that was said on a political radio, to be somewhere in the developing world and instead you get more issues of never working against the sensationality.",jbotkin1,jbotkin1_round3

209,209,231,constructive1,round3,79.0,4,"How many mothers who have actually had their children separated from them do you see? Very few. Typically, the people you see are privileged people who were born in the United States, who are American citizens, never had to migrate in search of a better life, talking abstractly about things they don't really have a personal understanding of. The people who are excluded from the debate, the actual people suffering from separation at the border have two important characteristics. Firstly, they bring the most important unique perspectives to the debate. We say that they are the people who are able to share stories that aren't necessarily found by the media that aren't necessarily found by independent investigators. They are able to share personal experiences that no one else has access to. Secondly, we say they're the most important, motivated advocates in order to solve this problem. They're never going to give up to solve a problem that deeply personally affects them and their quality of life. Where someone for whom that problem is merely academic may be willing to just give that up. Thirdly, we say they are the most effective communicators to motivate public change on this issue. Why is that the case? Because we say that they are able to use their emotions, which are a universal language that all human beings share to share the depth of the severity of their experience with others. Even if you come from a wealthy background and you've never suffered from political oppression, you can still understand what it feels like to be bullied or to be ashamed of some aspects as well, and we think this gives people who come from privileged backgrounds a greater capacity for political action and ability to empathize with people who are truly suffering from political oppression. 
This makes it easier for people from these backgrounds where they are oppressed, where they do suffer, to get society as a whole to mobilize on their behalf instead of only trying to make change themselves as minorities that are already disempowered. These three characteristics, we think, make it absolutely essential that people who may not necessarily be able to stay calm in a debate be part of that debate. Expectations that exclude them from the debate have to be removed from society.",rowanley,rowanley_round3
210,210,232,constructive2,round3,79.0,4,"Now, secondly, we tell you that anger and all other emotions have vital functions in the public sphere as a motivator of action. Understand that political systems act on mandates from the public, the political system responds to demands on it that are made by the public. We say that without anger, it's far more difficult to get action on issues that matter to people and it is particularly more difficult to get urgent action.
We say firstly, that minority groups who face disproportionate disadvantages due to their smaller sizes and a greater political disempowerment and lower political influence, need the use of strong emotions to break through the barrier of apathy that many of the general public feel about things that don't impact them. They need to be able to share with people emotions that they can relate to in order to break down the sense that something is not a personal issue to someone. When you relate an issue to personal feelings that someone has, maybe about other things in their past, then you're able to make that issue somewhat personal to them. You can make the separation of children deeply personal to someone even who's just experienced the frustration and anxiety like losing their children in the mall for a few hours. Obviously it's not emotion to the same depth, it's not the same kind of pain, but they can at least relate to the fact that's a painful, difficult experience and they can see that had they been born in someone else's shoes, it could have been them. I encourage right?",rowanley,rowanley_round3
211,211,233,constructive3,round3,79.0,4,"We say also that anger communicates urgency. Many problems need urgent solutions. The alleviation of families and the separation of children is not something that can wait for the long process of structured, calm, sober debate to come to a logical consensus. These are issues where there is a clear moral right and wrong. When people can come up with logical arguments that would seem to make clearly unjustifiable and amoral things acceptable, right? You can twist it and use logic to come up with almost anything, but it's very difficult to emotionally justify why it is acceptable to separate children from their parents.
We stated the use of emotional motivators, of saying if something is deeply affecting you personally, it needs to change immediately, can break through gridlock that doesn't allow urgent action to be taken. We say this urgent action is absolutely necessary to make sure that real, immediate human suffering is resolved and more abstract issues like the financial problems of pension plans can maybe be dealt with in a calm way at a later date because they don't have the same kind of urgency associated with them.",rowanley,rowanley_round3

I think it's already clear that we have an expectation that the government should provide K to 12 education because we recognize the impacts it has both on society and just the inherent right of the government to find these people. I think all needs to give us a meaningful reason why the difference between this preschool, birth to five, is meaningfully different than the obligation the government already has to K to 12.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2

Recognize that a three year old has no ability to make these choices. Yes. So, we think that this highly paternalized has a reciprocal reason why the government should be protecting these most vulnerable people. I think options tell us why like 20 old people like who have like the greater ability to self actualize, to choose their opinions deserve this.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2
129,129,248,constructive2,round2,80.0,4,"So, on pragmatics for parents. So, I think there are two options for parents. One is the parents right now are not paying the daycare. I think there's two options. I think, if they can't afford to pay for daycare, there are two things that happens. I think first is that the kid lacks. This parent is probably not trained in childhood development. So, even if the parent is doing something like reading to the child, it's not going to be as good a development for the child as something like daycare at a school because they're specialist insurance at best. But, it also harms the parent. There are many people who are forced to stay home because they can't afford $1,200 a month for daycare. So, what happens then? Parents who have a child are forced to stay home and give up other economic and personal opportunities because they need to support their child.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2
130,130,249,constructive2,round2,80.0,4,"Then on the kids. I think it's clear that the impact for them are better educations and better development. On personal health, often times healthcare is literally life or death and it's going to keep them alive because they have someone looking to see, ""Oh, they're vaccinated."" If they have some disease. This is particularly important for parents who come or for kids who come from low income or poorly educated parents who don't have the skills to identify some of the development issues they're facing. I think, also under this they get an education. So, we say that this has incredible future benefits. If you have an early education it provides you better for kindergarten and the rest of your education, which helps you lead into better career options or better jobs. Even if you don't choose to college. If you don't choose to go to college, you're better prepared for the workforce or vocational education.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2

I can't stress enough how much sitting at home, otherwise, your option is have bad teaching from parents or no teaching and you just get a mushy baby brain. Third, on college. I think we get as much college on our side of the house from a couple of reasons. One, parents are going to the money they've already spent on seeking funding into their child's education or their personal development.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2
132,132,251,constructive3,round2,80.0,4,"So, I think this looks like investing in their own personal safety. So, having this mom spend money that she would have spent on daycare on instead of getting a nursing degree so she can go help her society and help herself. Or, spending that money on her kids being able to go to college because of this investment. Secondly, the outside funding. So, recognize that private schools are still going to give out aid to everyone, especially low income people and diverse people because they want a diverse group of kids and they want more people coming to the school. Because, it looks good for them and gets them more outside funding.",gabbishilcusky,gabbishilcusky_round2
133,133,252,constructive3,round2,80.0,4,"Third, recognize that you get a better education. So, not only do we have as many people going to college, but we have better educated kids. Poor people who can now get this outside funding can still exists on our side of the house, who now get access. Recognize the kids are already privileged. They have the free time. They don't need a job so they can afford to go to college. They have financials that are seen to get loans. They have good K to 12 schools. Recognize that we primarily once we never get to go to college no matter what, because like with freedom and they don't have the chance due to their early childhood education.

If that's the case and you're allocating federal funding, you had much more likely to want it to go to preschool industries where those jobs can be developed. The number of people that work is just significantly higher. This actually is a reason why we would access some of the benefits that the opposition will give us because it creates a private incentive to develop education for that preschool industry.",ishanbhatt,ishanbhatt_round2

When you have universities posting in your education, that's pretty good. But if you expand it to a large amount, the value of the degree itself goes down. You see degree inflation because too much value is placed on getting a degree in the first place. These universities tend to spend millions of advertising, not letting in financially disadvantaged children, and these universities are likely to overestimate their own value. They're likely to pitch themselves as necessary, even in a world where a degree might not be that beneficial to the average person in the first place. It might be more economically beneficial to go into something else, but they're likely to sell themselves as that first place.",ishanbhatt,ishanbhatt_round2
143,143,275,constructive3,round2,80.0,4,"Third point of extension, this is where I'll answer closings POI. They missed an important comparative here. You cannot informally have a university it has to exist as an industry. You can informally do childcare. Why is it better to formally do childcare through professional institutions? Two reasons. First, in a world of informal childcare, if poor people are just saying to family friends or like relatives, please take care of my child, they'll stay at your house for this bit while I'm out at work. They're significantly more likely to be abused, treated badly, et cetera. When you have professional standards in an industry that can be held accountable through the market an industry that can be held accountable through the media and industry that has to be held accountable to shareholders, those situate any mistreating that has to be held accountable to the government, don't forget that part either. That industry is significantly likely to be less Second is psychology, those kids have to they're, they're taking care of your professional standards, issues that they may be having, might be taken care of because the teachers and professionals are changing theories of child's psychological development, et cetera. In an informal childcare industry, you get zero of those benefits, but in a formalized one, you get all of them",ishanbhatt,ishanbhatt_round2
144,144,64,constructive2,round2,80.0,4,"The second point of extension is where I think opening half has missed the debate. This was debate is not just in Western countries. There are universities developing in a lot of developing countries, but what does the situation look like? These universities are likely to be exclusive in a substantial manner, they're likely to only affect a significant, a significantly small proportion of the population and there's likely to be a population that's left behind because they're in a poor situation where they can get into those universities. It exaggerates experience. In the situation, child care is more beneficial. A, remember this motion talks about childcare funding involving medical conditions. People in these cities in developing countries have, do not have access to that substantial level of medical care. They can't live past enough to make it to a post secondary institution in the first place.",ishanbhatt,ishanbhatt_round2
145,145,75,constructive2,round2,80.0,4,"That's why it's beneficial to subsidize child care in those developing countries, I think the opening half has missed. Saying, its means that if you're able to better access education, this is the answer to both. This is also important here, when you funnel people into higher education, particularly the rising stars of marginalized communities, brain drain is more likely because if you don't have a system in which kids can be raised in that country. You know what those educated parents are going to do, they're going to dip because their kids can't be raised in a country where they don't have adequate childcare, which is a much more like.... Think about parental incentives, do parents care more about your child being alive and safe, or parents care more about the fact that they might be able to go back into the earlier community.

It is a favorable system as compared to for instance and electoral politic system, which is where playing on fears and playing on emotions is more likely to dominate. We can see a useful way of conceptualizing throughout. You can think about our side is defending an academic model and their side is defending a political model. We said our side of the house gets much more nuanced policy. They made arguments about academia but I don't think they have made good reasons why academia is substantially better. The reason is that you get more nuance in-depth, and this is the analysis we want to bring to you. For instance, in academia you are better equal to a Jud king plagued of history because you have an incentive to delve into the rectified power structures that exist in our country.",kflynndo,kflynndo_round3
177,177,210,constructive1,round3,79.0,4,"True. We'll do with this. Angie's arguments are remarkably un-comparative. Academia is not objective but is substantially more objective than subjective claims that exist in the policy in general. This is why things like for instance, Kimberly Crenshaw's claim intersectionality is not that 'I subjectively feel this to be true' but rather that there are indeed in the legal regime, existing pathways for instance where black people cannot get as great and cannot get as good but the unique social situation of black woman is not protected as a class- that is the inside of intersectionality, and that is the material fact that is not a subjective claim.
The same thing for instance with Richard Wallenstein demonstrated how the federal government segregated United States. It is not a subjective claim. It is a fact and that is how you get more policy that is better on our side of the house. Another example of this for instance is disrupting rectified power structures. For instance, where you understand federal colonialism as a fixture, as a structure rather than as an event that happened. We only get that by excavating the histories and relying on objective facts. So, on our side of the house, what we want to emphasize is that there is no way to communicate between subjective claims on their side of the house. Using academia as a hero stick, we think we get substantially better discourse that is more the wants and leads to the policies that actually solves the problem as it goes into banning solutions.",kflynndo,kflynndo_round3

Empirically, it shows that abortions are safer and they're much better for the women on the whole and for the child being brought into this world.

We think that one, if you're majoring in business or something, then one that's going to bring more jobs but two, if we have more higher skilled workers in these communities this is going to track to attract a lot of outside investment and a lot of outside capital from other countries, especially from high-skilled industries which we think in turn are going to fund their public schools, it's going to provide opportunities for these kids now to maybe have more summer internships or summer programs or whatever.",shg65,shg65_round2
420,420,127,constructive3,round2,75.0,2,"So finally I'm going to get into a little bit about political... Well first I'm going to talk about how we think that this applies not just to the US but to all countries, actually. So I'm going to say that first on the issue of developed countries, we think that the arguments that we've given here apply pretty well to all developed countries, where you need to get a good job in order to... Or where you need to get a good education in order to get a good job and actually move up through the economic hierarchy. We would also like to flag here that we think that due to automation eating up a lot of the jobs that we see today, that it's going to be especially important to get higher skilled jobs in the future, and if you don't have the skills necessary to do anything other than work as a cash register and now all of a sudden all of these are being automated, you're not going to have the money to take care of your kids at all, and this is just fundamentally harmful. So we need to make sure that these people have access to this education as quickly as possible. Second, in terms of developing developing countries, we think that these kinds of policies are far more important because you need higher skills in order to develop because they don't have other people within those communities to do it for them.

382,382,168,constructive1,round3,76.0,2,"active politics, we do believe that a lot of the times better policies in terms of the people that believe that politics should be ideally objective loses out because right wing politics are more fanatic and passionate politics wins out, only because of the fact that they seem to be motivated, right? In status quo, we believe that people that are just being a lot more passionate, but don't have better policies, win out only because of the terms of relatability, as opposed to people that are pursuing more idealistic, considerably non-manipulative politics lose out even though they do have better policies and even a better represent quality, right? We believe that being relatable is definitely something that comes from being a lot more active, a lot more persuasive, relating to your personal experiences, and being a lot more subjective, right? In current age's cool politics, we think that policy's losing out because individuals who believe in better policy are pursuing more objective politics, right? Now we're questioning the actual objectivity of politics in Do we think that the status quo of politics, even though excludes personal experiences and subjectivity and passionate content and rhetoric, do we actually believe that this is objective politics, right? SAI government believes that law is not really objective in terms of the fact that in presumably objective politics we believe that minorities and women, that essentially derive a lot of their passion and inspiration from their own personal experiences, as well as a motivator to change status quo experience of that kind of influence that'll suppress them, and utterly being hard because of the fact that objective has essentially skewed the words individuals that don't act from an aspiration or inspiration political, right? We believe that minorities and women always want to talk about things that have affected them and always want to talk about how they want to change things for the millions that face this exact same predicament, are being left out in objective, presumably objective, politics, only because every single time they ascribe to any of the personal experiences that have led them to stand for office, that have led them to relate to people who are facing the same experiences, are rejected in status quo politics by virtue of being overly passionate, overly emotional, right?
",ppk261,ppk261_round3
383,383,169,constructive2,round3,76.0,2,"Firstly, we believe that it's going to be inclusive by not only being to intellectuals. We necessarily believe that in the presumably objective politics that this isn't status quo, would be the right wing caters to the majority and left wing are more national and less persuasive. Presumably persuasive politics only caters to the intellectuals because we think that ideal politics are the most of dealing with politics is talking about logic and talking about facts and we do believe that there is a lot of value in these, but we believe that the relatability and presentation and value that most people expect politics to is lost by virtue of the fact that most of the majority is not really engaged with just facts and logic. It kind of washes over their heads and therefore, they're not really voting for right wing because they believe they are better politics, but just because they felt is was a lawful policy that was set. We believe that idealistic politics loses out on the presentation and value and presentation and value is what causes that line of engagement and transaction between representation and quality which is lost out on this objective narrative of what politics really is, right? We feel it's going to be a lot more inclusive in terms of talking to the majority, in terms of what we actually relate to and talk to the majority in something that we find persuasive. That way we engage them to actually listen to you and then in turn, listen to what policy you're really talking about, rather than just doing numbers and statics that someone who's gone to higher grad school is eager to without really motivating or provoking their attention, right? We believe this provocation of attention exists a lot more in a land where you're persuasive and active and relating your personal experiences, right? This is not to say that passionate politics is aggressive or violent politics. Through this characterization and there is SAI government is not really advocating for vengeful politics whatsoever We're just talking about a line where a lot more engaging and persuasive, as opposed to being docile and completely expressionless, right?",ppk261,ppk261_round3
384,384,170,constructive3,round3,76.0,2,"Why do we also believe it's inclusive other than catering to majority of the population, but also catering to minorities, right? to my earlier point about how a lot of representation of politics comes from people that face experiences and essentially, the of those experiences will tell people that, ""Hey, you know we're in the same position as you guys and we feel like these are the problems that we face and we want to change status quo for you because we know this is exactly what a quality base is."" We believe this is not going to exist in a paltry, objective narrative. In terms of in existing narratives, Grasso's campaign is basically impossible of right?
You wouldn't see in objective narratives anyone like AOC actually rising up from Grasso's campaigning because an entire campaign the fact that Latino-Americans face these kind of experiences and that relates to the immigrant population which is a vast majority of Americans and ""I feel you, so you'll listen to me, right?""

They try to argue that it's a myth that the housing bubble is continuing to happen because of some unspecified regulation that has been introduced since 2008, keep in mind they didn't tell you any examples of new regulation that has been introduced. We would tell you that no, in reality, we have not learned from our mistakes. Why? Because we continue to see massively spiking housing markets.",magagne,magagne_round1

This is especially true when you look outside of the United States, which was most directly affected by the subprime crisis in terms of their own legislation.

359,359,156,constructive1,round5,76.0,2,"Second, religions legitimize that if you can't do certain things in public then you do not have the right, you do not have the necessity to. For example, the Quran makes accommodations for women who just cannot work jobs. Like for things like if they can't work with it, that is specifically in the Quran. If you cannot work with a hijab, then you do not have to wear the hijab. That means that religions make allowances for these things so it is not a complete violation of your religion because there are accommodations that can be made. And finally, remember that they punish the victims as well by making the burden fall on them when federal funding is taken away. We think that courts are always going to be better mechanism.",mstonem,mstonem_round5
360,360,157,constructive2,round5,76.0,2,"We say the lag time of courts is far better because you have the same mechanism of having these laws, you have the same impact of having these laws be in place, you don't have the additional harm of not having federal funding for important social programs anymore. We say that that's far more important. They also don't answer the fact that it can just be overturned later depending on the government. If you believe that there is any justification for why this or why any of these laws might not be a violation of religious freedom, you believe that there will be no precedent to keep these laws enshrined. And therefore you can go back and forth with each administration not having a solid law.",mstonem,mstonem_round5
361,361,158,constructive3,round5,76.0,2,"Next we think that the courts are better because there's going to be violation of basic democratic rights when you take a specific policy for states and you have the federal government decide. If they say the federal government is elected so therefore it's better, but state and provincial governments are elected too, they're just more directly elected. You have a smaller body of people, so therefore your vote has more impact. We say the people of Quebec know far better what is important for Quebec than these federal bodies because they are far more distant. They have the cultural differences, and it's just a huge group of people you are counting for the interests of a much smaller group of people. We say that the federal government does not have the right to decide of the interests of Quebec specifically. They say that these aren't legitimate interests because a headscarf doesn't accurately hurt others. But what Chris gives you is some very solid analysis. But why the interest Quebec are unique because they have a more cultural conflict.",mstonem,mstonem_round5
