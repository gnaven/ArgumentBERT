We think that religious liberties are inalienable, and we think that it should be impossible to deny people those religious liberties. We think that doing otherwise would conflate church and state because when governments impose preventative rather than laissez faire rules on religious liberties, we think that those governments in doing so are imposing judgments on religions.

We think that those value conflict over those laws have created religious tension as a result of conflating church and state. We think that laws that violate religious liberties generally, they backlash these laws, which spills over, beyond just the application of those laws. We think that the nature of religion is something that can unite people, which means that if a group of people receive the law as being sort of discriminatory or unjust to the group that they sort of operate within, then that sort of motivates backlash. Not just from the victim of the law, but for the entire group that that person represents, which means that backlash spills over and becomes a federal problem. ",meganwu,meganwu_round5

Therefore, this means that these laws are usually also racialized in nature and indict certain countries in different areas of the world, which we do want to maintain good relations with. For example, laws against Jewish religious practices will definitely strain the relations of countries with Israel. And laws against Muslim headgear, for example, will definitely strain relations with the primarily Muslim countries. We think that in order for countries to sort of maintain their role in the global arena and also maintain good relations with other countries and also be respectful of other peoples' practices, it's important that federal governments establish precedence so that violations of religious liberties are not tolerated within countries.

We think that punitive measures were violating federal laws or other rights the sovereign should federal system of both state systems is not maintained.

So when you start using hate speech, mainstream politicians are not going to be automatically. Let me talk about minority narratives. Let me talk about these ideas that they see themselves as fringe. What happens is those narratives just get more excluded because the subjectivity that people are most strong about is going to be this idea of the language that is more racist, more homophobic, and even if you do find their point, that there happens to be a greater impact of minority voices, the amount of hate speech that it incites from the other side of the amount of racism or homophobia or sexism, but then incite. Is it going to be more helpful? You're going to get politicians that are more likely to be populous, more likely to be Democrats that will lead from backslides of the democracy into authoritarianism. We tell you this is especially dangerous in countries where you don't have the same sort of free speech for hecklers and stuff. The language used mattered. You are able to talk and have discussions about what minorities think is important through policy decisions, not just focus on these pleased emotionality.

Oftentimes we think they're angry and they miss the nuance of policy because they're stuck in their echo chamber as well. We also think moderates feel excluded when only talking about exclusion. We all know that there is a silent majority that doesn't get their voice heard because they feel that they don't fit into either of the echo chambers.

We think the stereotype of women being more emotional can cause us to perceive them as overly dramatic, sentimental, unstable, because it's not the ideal. Because we view it as a problem, and we think we see this with Warren and Kamala, who focus a lot on personal appeals and stories and are often dismissed for that reason: because they're not rational. Especially with someone like Elizabeth Warren, that she's just a populist trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that she's too emotional to be in this race. We think that racial minorities are more often sidelined from being viewed as angry and irrational. We think particularly people in the black community often have their arguments dismissed, because they're perceived as too angry. We think we saw this with the discourse around Black Lives Matter, which for the most part was not violent and when they ... But the whole movement was very quickly characterized as violent, because we think we're ready to penalize emotion as being something bad, and because of this narrative that says that that should not exist in our political discourse. We also think it's a white male construct, because people who have more to lose are always going to be more emotional. It is the luxury of the privileged to be able to talk about issues that don't personally affect them in a flat tone, in a neutral way, and be like, ""Oh, I can see both sides of it."" When your life is on the line, you can't see both sides. When your access to an abortion puts your autonomy at risk, you're going to be more angry about it. And so, we think what we do when we put emphasis on objectivity is we raise the voices of the privileged who can afford to be neutral, and we minimize the people whose real experiences are too intense, too painful, to just have this flat affect and not express their own subjective experiences when they talk about these issues.

Secondly, we think you are going to think more rationally and extensively about issues that directly affect you. So just all other things being equal, a candidate like Warren is going to think about women's issues a lot more closely than Bernie is going to, because they're directly going to impact her life, and so we think that promotes more extensive thought. We think this is important with the debate around abortion. Women's voices should be the most important around abortion. Not every man should be able to get up and say their opinion on abortion is equally important, because it's not when it doesn't affect them and it doesn't have a direct impact on their lives. The same thing with cisgender people constantly speculating about the transgender community, who don't get their subjective experience at all.

So it sort of ties people down to a specific spot.

The same thing for instance with Richard Wallenstein demonstrated how the federal government segregated United States. It is not a subjective claim. It is a fact and that is how you get more policy that is better on our side of the house. Another example of this for instance is disrupting rectified power structures.

This parent is probably not trained in childhood development. So, even if the parent is doing something like reading to the child, it's not going to be as good a development for the child as something like daycare at a school because they're specialist insurance at best. But, it also harms the parent. There are many people who are forced to stay home because they can't afford $1,200 a month for daycare. So, what happens then?

This is particularly important for parents who come or for kids who come from low income or poorly educated parents who don't have the skills to identify some of the development issues they're facing.

They are justified only because, they are rejecting the political debate, and it manifests like them rejecting the media as fake news and it manifests has done like rejecting the political discussion. The research that scientists have about global warming, about how it is a certainty, right? It is projecting the objective truths of our debate, that still happened in the study school. Because of this projection of truths, we have people that are not necessarily engaging in the world. The role of narrative, as I said before, therefore; is to push for questioning. To push for one accuracy of political belief. Like actually what is the accuracy of the policy or the belief that you're holding, right? Like, is it actually substantiated in the real world?

So, what do we get without it? Three key aspects here: first of all, we get better voting if we still have the narrative in place. Without it; we get worse voting, because we have populism rising throughout the world. For example, in Europe we have many, many parties that are super right wing, like the alternative for Germany, your Marine Le pen.

578,578,52,constructive1,round2,78.0,3,"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?",pmanisca,pmanisca_round2
579,579,9,constructive1,round2,78.0,3,"Yes, it is true that most of these pressures are from norms. But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

The reason we like leftist opinions I think objectively and straight is because we think we're generally right about the world. We think that there is discrimination. We think there is sexism, we think there is all classism, but what structural aspects of personal narratives diffuse this, three. First, any argument against a personal narrative is then perceived as a personal attack. If you have someone whose objective, emotional experience is just like my family was attacked by immigrants and you're just like immigrants statistically don't really commit crime or the people, but, my family was attacked by immigrants. When you give that narrative the same emotional weight, comfortability and acceptance by like a swing voter who's just like, man, that statistic and like, God, I love this narrative. That is what results. If that's the case, then you get worse debate because you can't deflate narratives that are lies because you can't attack a narrative on its merits. It's in a narrative that you can't refute. Second, there's perceived as legitimately contested there. Unless you have a countervailing narrative. What this creates is a race to get the most marginalized person on your talk show. It's like, see if like one talk show comes up with like a Brown person is just like, this person thinks this about Trudeau's random black face or Brown face. And then the next conservative talk show, we'll try to find like Dinesh D'Souza to like say something about how Brown face is good and it creates like inclusionary politics because he's a conservative pack. The point is when you elevate people's personal identity to the level of elephant and cherry, et cetera, you get anyone who has a right to claim that identity, to be able to talk about that experience, to be able to say, this is what's going on, this is what I think is the case.

There's no narrative to tell me that debate is about putting stuff that I think about the world on the chopping block to see what people have to say about it. This is the highest probability impact because regardless of whatever mechanisms you think affect people's political discourse. Political debate is important because it encourages people to go through first, second, and third line responses to their positions.

That is to say, the rhetoric that is used when you are talking about why we should allow immigrants into the country is often based on the rhetoric of, for example, losing access to jobs that you think are going to be replaced by these groups of people. We see a world in which we create immediate pressure on the working-class people that vote for xenophobic policies by directly taking away the resources that they often need, they realize that their politicians that they voted for largely on an economic basis are probably lying to them in this regard and they're also likely, at least in some states that question the policies that they're dealing with. Sure.",jacobsilcoff,jacobsilcoff_round5

The many people that are usually affected might lack access to health care, might lack access to education in the short term. We're going to justify why this is acceptable. Okay. So firstly, I think the most important active group here are the people that passively support religious rights that are inevitably impacted by what these policies look like, right? People that are relatively privileged, relatively affluent that might say that they support religious freedom who are never going to actually do anything about it. They don't necessarily they don't engage in protests, they don't do anything to sort of push this agenda, right? We see that now that they are personally tied to the types of impacts these people are facing, because just like the people that are affected by these bills, they, too, don't get access to these resources, we see that millions of people that previously passively supported these now actively support them, right? We see much more mass mobilization of people that are now willing to protest, to vote, to convince other people to be involved in these issues, to speak out for people that are marginalized when they, too, are personally impacted by the marginalization that happens.

I've already gone into intergenerational benefit that we're getting here, where on our side we're helping people now so that they can then in turn have better lives and they won't be stuck in the same... And their children won't be stuck in the same situation that they are. We think that one of the things that we're looking at here is the cycle of poverty.",shg65,shg65_round2
418,418,117,constructive1,round2,75.0,2,"So first of all, short term benefits, we're sending people to school. There's some very obvious benefits here. We're giving them the ability to get the skills necessary to get higher paying, higher skilled jobs. We think that this is critically important. What we're looking at here is on their side, they would give the money right now to parents that want to send their kids to day care or whatever, which they should, that's great, but then we look on our side and we say, but if we give this money to someone right now who cannot afford to go to post secondary education, we're going to give them a better life in the long term. We're going to give them access to a better job, which is then in turn going to result in this intergenerational benefit because now they won't have to worry about not being able to afford to send their kids to primary school.",shg65,shg65_round2
419,419,125,constructive3,round2,75.0,2,"So second of all, in terms of longterm benefits, I want to talk about how this is going to bring more capital to these low income communities that I think that we're primarily looking at here in this debate. So we think that the people that we're talking about that we're sending off to get an education are very likely to... I mean surely not all of them are going to come back, right? But we think that they have ties to these communities. This is where they grew up, this is where their family is, so I think that a lot of them are going to come back to these communities and they're going to bring better jobs. We think that one, if you're majoring in business or something, then one that's going to bring more jobs but two, if we have more higher skilled workers in these communities this is going to track to attract a lot of outside investment and a lot of outside capital from other countries, especially from high-skilled industries which we think in turn are going to fund their public schools, it's going to provide opportunities for these kids now to maybe have more summer internships or summer programs or whatever.",shg65,shg65_round2
420,420,127,constructive3,round2,75.0,2,"So finally I'm going to get into a little bit about political... Well first I'm going to talk about how we think that this applies not just to the US but to all countries, actually. So I'm going to say that first on the issue of developed countries, we think that the arguments that we've given here apply pretty well to all developed countries, where you need to get a good job in order to... Or where you need to get a good education in order to get a good job and actually move up through the economic hierarchy. We would also like to flag here that we think that due to automation eating up a lot of the jobs that we see today, that it's going to be especially important to get higher skilled jobs in the future, and if you don't have the skills necessary to do anything other than work as a cash register and now all of a sudden all of these are being automated, you're not going to have the money to take care of your kids at all, and this is just fundamentally harmful. So we need to make sure that these people have access to this education as quickly as possible. Second, in terms of developing developing countries, we think that these kinds of policies are far more important because you need higher skills in order to develop because they don't have other people within those communities to do it for them. ",shg65,shg65_round2
282,282,165,constructive1,round3,76.0,2,"So now let's go to why the ideal political debate happens on our side. Why do emotional appeals obfuscate the responsibility of the political system and what is politically right? Why? Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.",djasson,djasson_round3
283,283,166,constructive2,round3,76.0,2,"Furthermore, we talked about the political debate. Needing to produce the best result, you need to pull together the most local information and how a reasoning that can be weighed and your emotional bandwidth is limited. So therefore, even if you can empathize with everyone, you can't keep up and emotional aspects of debate wear off far quicker than logical reasoning. We think fragmentation of experience means that emotions go both ways. That means again, if you feel very strongly about marginalized people in your country emotionally, well someone can feel the exact same way and the other way and it's a wash. We think that fragmentation of experience is also why there's not enough action on issues like gun control or climate change because everyone has only small experiences that don't pull together to the big picture, that only data and reasoning can explain.",djasson,djasson_round3
346,346,171,constructive1,round2,76.0,2,"Our first independent argument is about the longterm success of children. We argue that early childhood care creates a positive feedback loop because children who have early childhood care, have the greatest ability to engage in... Have the greatest ability to learn material later down the line because of increased care and attention that they're given as children. We think that these strong resources that they've been given early and they're carried through to later parts of your life, which results in increased preparation for college and increased success when they're in college. A couple subpoints to this argument. So first... So our Subpoint A is that we can add readiness, we can have readiness after early childhood care is incredibly important, not just when students enter college, but also leading up to college. So throughout the entire primary and secondary education system, we also think that the educational benefits that they gained in early childhood education accrued through those years as well. So we think that early childhood education affects all 12 plus years of education. Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student. Which means that aren't super expensive per student compared the price of early childhood education. Because early childhood education requires of people who are specifically trained to deal with young children. It requires attention at all times. Yes.",meganwu,meganwu_round2
347,347,172,constructive2,round2,76.0,2,"We think that the... This means that we have to increase the ability of students, especially low income students or students of color to access early childhood education because doing so would do more to resolve these educational inequities. We think this  answers any arguments raised by the off teams about inequities that arise later in college because inequities going into college are largely created by inequities that started in early childhood education. We also think that as early childhood education always includes like medical care. We think that medical attention or medical support for families can also help resolve psychological issues that can make it harder for students to succeed in school.",meganwu,meganwu_round2
348,348,173,constructive3,round2,76.0,2,"Our third independent argument is that early childhood education is super important for parents. We can have parents because ECC includes support for parents, we think that the need for this that falls in parents is greater than the need for funding for students because college students a higher ability to take care of themselves. For example, they are hopefully self-sufficient adults, maybe not, I don't know, but hopefully college students are more self-sufficient than a toddler who requires attention at all times. Moreover, the parents who call hopefully don't have to do that much to support their students, but the parents of toddlers or young infants have a ton of burdens to fall on them. For example, they have to have the burden of starting a career, raising a child, and possibly taking care of their own parents and that ways, which means that support for a parents accrues exponentially in the longterm as well. And for example, if the parent of a young child has more support going into early childhood care and that allows them to be a better chance to start their own career running. And then have more money down the line to fund or support their child's post-secondary education.",meganwu,meganwu_round2
349,349,29,constructive1,round2,76.0,2,"But we also think that this Subpoint B we just made resolves this argument, or at least rebuilds our argument in opposition to this. Because the price of community college slightly increases students will also have the greater ability to financially plan or more financial literacy in general if they have access options like early childhood. So now our second independent argument is that we think that our model closes educational inequities. So we think that in educational inequity, speaking at an early age for example, studies show that differences in vocabulary with standardized testing abilities start as early as early childhood care and that differences in early childhood care or the amount of time that gets spent as ages lead to differences later down the line.",meganwu,meganwu_round2

I could do that, but it might be harder to do that because my savings is being drained over years and years by a punitive tax. Again, let's look at the word punitive here.
