We think that investments are really important to revitalize economies, reduce poverty, increase leverage for political benefit and for even leveraging this against human rights abuses or government abuses occurring within these nations.

For example, they can donate to things like charity or they can donate to other businesses that they run in order to make more profits. We think that switching their focus from simply real estate investment into other forms of business would be better because at least they don't result in the practical harms of homelessness that we see in today's society.

This is a protest movement where everyone rallied in the streets and they had drum circles going all day for weeks. There were people out camping.

They relied too much on how the collapse made them feel rather than what they were going to do about it.

So the first subsect of this argument is that we think that it's obvious that people should get religious liberties. We think that religious liberties are inalienable, and we think that it should be impossible to deny people those religious liberties. We think that doing otherwise would conflate church and state because when governments impose preventative rather than laissez faire rules on religious liberties, we think that those governments in doing so are imposing judgments on religions.

We think that those value conflict over those laws have created religious tension as a result of conflating church and state. We think that laws that violate religious liberties generally, they backlash these laws, which spills over, beyond just the application of those laws. We think that the nature of religion is something that can unite people, which means that if a group of people receive the law as being sort of discriminatory or unjust to the group that they sort of operate within, then that sort of motivates backlash. Not just from the victim of the law, but for the entire group that that person represents, which means that backlash spills over and becomes a federal problem. ",meganwu,meganwu_round5

Therefore, this means that these laws are usually also racialized in nature and indict certain countries in different areas of the world, which we do want to maintain good relations with. For example, laws against Jewish religious practices will definitely strain the relations of countries with Israel. And laws against Muslim headgear, for example, will definitely strain relations with the primarily Muslim countries. We think that in order for countries to sort of maintain their role in the global arena and also maintain good relations with other countries and also be respectful of other peoples' practices, it's important that federal governments establish precedence so that violations of religious liberties are not tolerated within countries.

We think that punitive measures were violating federal laws or other rights the sovereign should federal system of both state systems is not maintained.

We say with objectivity, you have a much more chance of acknowledging the structural barriers. So identity politics would become about branding. Elections would be based on this. Political discourse would become focused on experiences rather than policy. This will happen because politicians would be more concerned about building up their ethos over their policy and tearing down other ethos. Elections would become about who was a better candidate. Not in the sense of, are they going to do better things for our country, but who we'd rather want running us. And then their ethos would be elected. So politicians won't be seen as their idea, they'd just be seen as their sum of their experiences. Which is problematic in multiple ways. One, because politicians need to represent people who have different experiences than just their own. There are very few people who've lived the exact same lives as the politician has currently lived. So they need to be able to represent people beyond the scope of themself, have either had slightly different experiences or largely different experiences.Especially in terms of senators and the president, who have to represent large groups of people rather than just one rural community.

I think that, when we talk about our personal experiences in your own interactions with policy, you would need to bring up your own experiences which brings up emotion, and you also are discounting the value... The validity of this personal experience as a role to that. I think when we talk about issues... When we talk about policy and different social issues, you need this nuance, you need this personal experience, and we can't just have this idea of being objective is the only right way because you end up losing so much, you tend to lose your idea, lose the ability to actually have a conversation of productive conversation where you can have your mind changed because you don't believe that they're... What they're saying... What the other side is saying is bad. I think also the huge problem is that this idea of losing the validity of your experience in your emotions, distances, the effects that policies have on people when you're actually talking about implementation and everything. I think that this inherently hurts a lot of different groups that are already at the edges of society.

Remortgaging increases equality through the following mechanism. You can remortgage your house through what you invest in it to invest or simply to get you out of tricky situations. For example, if you're caught up in court, what you can do is remortgage your house to help pay for very expensive law bills, which also disproportionately affect the middle class.

I think this is the exact kind of incompetent monetary policy that we're trying to prevent. The kind of things that cause hyper inflation because you have a lack of transfer of information for regimes who are corrupt, have debt dealings with us. State owned enterprises that they use to propagate corruption that you mitigate on our side. When you tie nations together trying to help those nations actually like financially and economically recover. Even if you have one nation that is propped within that are or many nations that are propped within that sphere. Everybody has a collective interest in wanting the nations to succeed economically so you have more information going around as to what is the best move monetarily in order to heal those nations. I think when they say that thirdly that they have different contexts in which they're going to evaluate whether inflation is good, do we want the interest rate higher or low? All these things just recognize in ACIAR what ties them together relatively is that they're exporting nations that they want by a common interest in trade. Are they more over? You would also say that each of these nations within ACIAR, when they're governed monetary policy want to account for those different, who's differences and how they affect the economies because of the tight incentive that they have now. I think when they say that Singapore is a bigger economy of the end of their case, talking about how they're going to have the most power recognize that's in the status quo within the framework of ACIAR but also they should have the ability to within ACIAR to descend and generally they need to reach a consensus but then secondarily even if they have more power comparatively they care more in our world because they're able to bail out those countries.

But secondly is the financing all things within using that currency, whether it's debt that they need to be using that currency for or whether it's going to be hurting international trade. All those reasons are why they care. The members of ACIAR grow to care about each other when they're tied together with a currency like the comparative is that China is much easier able to pick off countries like Vietnam, Cambodia because they put their individual interests over that of Southeast Asia. We tip that balance towards Southeast Asia rather than individual interests when they're having to go China because of the fact that they care about, they care more about the success in Southeast Asia. Another way in which we place a third way in which we increased the ties between Southeast Asian nations is that when you decrease the transactions costs of trade and we'll need to have more trade presents within ACIAR itself, that means you've increased the regional ties between each other. That means you're more likely to say my economy is now as a larger share of that did buy trade within ACIAR as opposed to China, are willing to vote interest of ACIAR. Honestly, this idea of how they say it, if they have conflicting interest, why would they ever go and balance each other, bail each other out? That's a problem that exists right now in the status quo. That's what we're trying to solve. The comparative on their side is they go to places like the IMF and China that are horrible actors to get their loans, their loans and then debt finance. I think the horrible thing is that now that we get to change for our side is that we have a currency that ties in together and that when those individual nations fail, every nation within that system, especially the rich nations like Singapore are going to shell out the cash to make sure that those nations are able to rebound and the currency is able to be stable.",123dyly,123dyly_round4
106,106,312,constructive1,round4,80.0,4,"So first, about better economic policy. There's largely two reasons you've got this. First is I think you're getting more investment and more trade just because there's a lower currency risk when you have a centralized currency. There's two reasons for this case. First, internally there are zero currency risk. So when Thailand is trading with Cambodia when a business is investing in Cambodia, it means that the business does not have to worry that Cambodia's currency will collapse and all of their profits go to zero in a particular year. So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.
",amspector100,amspector100_round4
107,107,313,constructive2,round4,80.0,4,"So second, I want to talk about how you can get more stable monetary policy. That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability. That is to say, if there's more jobs for people, we think there's less political discontent. You're likely see the things like inflammation of the middle class and as a result, I don't know, it's just better",amspector100,amspector100_round4
108,108,314,constructive3,round4,80.0,4,"The second argument is about better economic and political integration. A couple of arguments on this. First, we think that with more trade you're likely to see more negotiating power for this block as a whole. That means that when China says, ""Hey Cambodia, we would like to do X, we would like to go on this particular Cambodia doesn't have to take the deal. Right? Cambodia isn't as... The ratio of power between Cambodia and China is still skewed to China side, but it gets better. So this means Cambodia can do things like incrementally advocate for better working conditions for people. It means it can incrementally advocate for slightly lower tariffs on its products so it can export things to China too. This is critical because, we think that these countries, especially if they're discussing to start a block, are smart enough not to dilute their comparative advantage, but at the same time ensure that there are basic guarantees of safety to things like their workers, like human rights and working conditions that are not available in these countries right now.",amspector100,amspector100_round4

But importantly, notice also here that there are plenty of nonfinancial barriers to universities, to accessing universities. Things like the neighborhood in which you live in.

Therefore, it becomes more profitable. Early childhood care lacks all of the sexiness that happens when you try to get private actors to buy a post-secondary education.

So if more people in the same space and per person, less utility. We will say you're less needing to drive places, which means your environmental cost there goes down.",jacobsilcoff,jacobsilcoff_round1

When you bring a bunch of food into a city, it can be distributed to millions of people as opposed to going to tons of different directions on trucks, much lower environmental costs. Generally, cities are way better for the environment. We say on that basis alone, it's worth creating this incentive to help the environment. We say that there are societal benefits because when you're renting to people and you're literally your own house, you're a lot more likely to be mixed with different social classes. When you're riding public transit, you might be likely to see people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. You care about their issues because they're literally your neighbors and to reduce instrumentation on the basis of rich people that own their houses are now more likely to rent them to people that are probably poor off. We say that that's probably good for the social interests with people that are voting in these elections.

When you invest in a house, you can't just move if you need to get a new job somewhere else without going through the hassle of selling your house, especially if you have a mortgage, it can be incredibly difficult to do. So it sort of ties people down to a specific spot. We've seen, I think, it's actually for someone that has an unstable job situation, it's much easier because you can get up and move if you need to, you're not tied down to a specific place. If you have a lower income and then get a higher one, it's easier for you to move into a better place. But just say renting is a really good stable thing for you.",jacobsilcoff,jacobsilcoff_round1

Why is it good for society? I think we have both societal and individual reasons. So in terms of the societal reasons, we see that there are a few things. When you live in a rented place, you necessarily have more density. Why is this? If you're renting a place, one, if you're renting your living room, all of a sudden, boom, that double the housing density because you have more people living in the same footprint increase housing density. Would also say that when you invest in a place with the intention of renting, you have more places in a smaller space so that you could have one set of utilities for the entire place you're renting.

Whereas; when you're a child... Is shut out of being able to see you in school because they don't have adequate food to fill their stomach when they're trying to learn basic math.

The results from an early developmental intervention are permanent because of that biological nature. So just think that by reducing...

As my partner said, majority experience is the wealthy white majority that controls like a lot of the media and that already controls the narratives under status quo. Those experiences of the majority are inherently very widespread and well known. When we introduced this subjectivity as a valued element, we think that the subjective experiences which are under status quo, less well known will become more well known because they will be valued and which experiences are least well known are precisely those which are from the most marginalized communities.

We think if people have like no other assets, right? This incentive to say that you get through home ownership, is creating that when you sell your house, the liquidity that you need to be able to provide for retirement versus rent, where you are paying into a system that goes nowhere and that is probably inherently exploitive. Remember, I'm expand on this a bit later, but just because you had a mortgage that was bad and no one was able to you, just because you turn into a renter doesn't mean you now inherently have more social capital and politicians are suddenly going to respond to you. [CEG 00:01:05] gives us the idea that when people have this unattainable dream, they're going to make bad decisions, but we think either way, you have a situation where people are just renting and seeing no alternative.",jbotkin1,jbotkin1_round1

It's not that you have people in urban areas or places that are super expensive and then these suburbs that were planted in the 1950s. But that people in places like the inner city in places like Baltimore or East San Jose, or the Bronx or Queens in New York city, where people who have low socioeconomic status are owning homes, the problem is that when you force them to switch to renting or create a tax for them that is too expensive, they aren't able to do things like pay their mortgage and have this punitive tax so they are now forced out into a system where they have nowhere else to turn.",jbotkin1,jbotkin1_round1

[OO 00:05:07] talks a little bit about this idea of family stability, but remember in our extension we tell you it's not just family stability, it's a good community ties, is that you could have a local store on the corner that someone tried to eventually own one day, and sort of build up that wealth that is helpful when that area eventually gets gentrified and you are able to sell that place for more money, but also the idea that you're able to build social capital, organizations and people being able to stay in the same place.",jbotkin1,jbotkin1_round1

This leads to homelessness, gentrification, people being driven out their homes. People not being able to afford rent, or even if they do afford rent, they can't afford anything else like education and healthcare and this is the major problem that we need to solve.

We want to incentivize people to sell land like that so then they can be more efficiently reallocated to people who need it, right? So how does our mechanism solve this works?

They can afford to give loans to some people who will never be able to pay back their mortgage, and in fact, they actively try to give loans to these individuals so that they'll be able to foreclose those homes in the future and get assets back on them.

The people living in your area just at least see housing prices go up over time, indefinitely and permanently into the future.

So what you get is a situation where people have to deal with their mortgage on their house that they bought because they couldn't afford it in the first place, and it was hard to deal with this house that they now can't resell.

We think this is important with the debate around abortion. Women's voices should be the most important around abortion. Not every man should be able to get up and say their opinion on abortion is equally important, because it's not when it doesn't affect them and it doesn't have a direct impact on their lives.

One, the connection that you made from university to individuals from the class are necessary to succeed in the class. Two, there are industry requirements, I.e. if you want to be an elite in business, you have to have a certain business degree to be able to get your introductory job. And three, the degree themselves acts as some kind of a signal of your capability to be involved with the elite class. University is in fact the tipping point at which a low income individual is able to join an elite class in some sense. I.e. people who are low income individuals are able to go to Oxford, still become judges, lawyers and politicians. The people that are able to have large scale implements. This is the most important impact in the round. If we're able to take even a small number of low income individuals that otherwise wouldn't have gone to university and put them into positions of power as policymakers, legislators and judges, those are people that now have the background to understand the issues that low income individuals face. Those are the people that are most likely to advocate for increasing funding that goes towards early child education and post-secondary education for low income students. Those are people that are creating the longterm change that they're trying to fight for. This is most important impact from the round.
One additional piece we think is important to point out is that government money that goes towards universities isn't just going towards the direct education themselves. It also has important spillover effects into research that we think are really critical. Particularly in non-profitable areas of research, there's a public policy, education and psychology that don't happen to your business impacts and lead to poor profit funders not funding them. Research in these areas only happens, even at really elite universities, where there's sufficient outside funding to fray the cost of hiring the researchers, hiring the students as RAs and having enough of a classroom teaching environment that they have the other university resources to be able to have powerful research departments in the first place.

Because when we're talking about this tax and we're talking about this punitive tax applying equally, we are talking about a lot of poor communities that the younger generation inherit from their parents and and their grandparents before that.",vkamr052,vkamr052_round1
233,233,183,constructive1,round1,79.0,4,"I think when we're talking about these communities we also need to qualify a little bit, the unique historical and cultural value a lot of these communities offer, which isn't necessarily something that you can quantify, but it's something that means a lot to these communities and it's something that has meant a lot, especially, to marginalized communities who haven't had a lot of dignity in the way they've been treated by the state and the way they've been treated in a lot of the communities that the first speaker, the prime minister comes up and mentions, when he talks about the fact that white folks were very exclusive in their housing practices generations ago. I think we need to recognize that that's something... The stability that that offers, and I am with my partner's points about how it also makes it easier just to have a community of people where you know your neighbors, where you can go out and practice, go to your local churches and establish local institutions. Not only does that make life cheaper and easier, but it also makes life more stable for youth growing up in this community. On the comparative, I think that's uniquely valuable and I think uniquely, like keep that under our side of the house, when we make it just cheaper and easier to be a marginalized person and a poor person in these communities.",vkamr052,vkamr052_round1
234,234,184,constructive2,round1,79.0,4,"On to the point of local politics. And I think this is something where, O.G didn't really talk a lot on. When we talk about these areas, we're not just talking about stability. We're also talking about political stability. As someone who's renting a house, I think that renting a house just because of the point that... Especially in this class is very well the government's point on the idea that like as a renter, you're constantly in the state of a housing mobility. You're constantly trying to move around, evaluate your opportunities for what the cheapest possible alternative to where you're living is. I think having this process is even worse when you have predatorial rental practices on the part of large corporations. So I don't think you necessarily get to invest in your community, politically speaking, the way you would under a situation where you can actually own a house. I think this is especially true in areas where local politics is super important. Where you vote on air, where you vote on your judges and you vote on attorneys. Where all of these voting decisions and political decisions tangibly affect how your community is shaped in the future.",vkamr052,vkamr052_round1
235,235,230,constructive1,round3,79.0,4,"Second question I want to bring up in this debate is why you get voters to come out and bring social cohesion. Because objective politics simply does not bring you enough justification on things such as care and empathy. What does that look like? It looks like the fact that political discussion would not be surrounded by John who said to that white police saying that, ""I want the best for you. I love you. Can I give you a hug?"" Right? These are things that will be subjected under our side and let us have the ability to unite people because these are incidents that will get African Americans to come out here and vote. Note the system that African Americans and minorities believe in are already flawed. They believe governments alienate them. That is why without subjective accounts saying that the person besides you might be killed and therefore you should come out to vote, those individuals would never turn out to the voting poll, and that is a greatest atrocity to an entire democratic practices, because democracy is premised on the fact that individuals have equal say. The moment when I only care about philosophical or political goals of mainly the very highest class form of objectivity is a moment when these individuals will be put in trains and never have their say in a political system. The ways in which you should engage with them therefore, is to feed into the society saying that your friends or your family members might be killed by white police, and therefore you should come up here and vote. The reasoning why we go for it in opening government is through the fact that we prove to you why subjectivity and objectivity can go in hand, and individuals will have the right to judge it by more to propose",wesleychiu,wesleychiu_round3

Firstly, why is it still worse for every actor involved, the province or a state, it accepts this policy and cooperates. Secondly, what happens when funding is actually cut? Firstly, why is it still worse for all actors involved? Recognize that the popular will underlying this issue does not simply go away. It simply masks it at the point in which what is quantified as legislator is just not allowed anymore, it's just prohibited. We think that there are three main harms that you should care about. Firstly, it is worse for the religious population within that province or state because they now become a target of resentment within that province or state. Politicians have an incentive to shift the blame on these people for forcing their obedience to the federal government because they don't want to seem incompetent. They don't want to seem like their political agenda was compromised by the federal state.",andrewyun7,andrewyun7_round5

Even people who are largely indifferent are now going to be moved to discriminate and hate these people in these countries [crosstalk 00:02:54] because now it is directly tied to who you are, who you identify with. Whether you are a Quebecer or not it is a very nationalistic issue and even people who weren't that tied to the religious aspect of this debate, of this controversy, now it becomes tied to who I am and what defines me as a Quebecer, which is you know, much more of an issue that is likely to divide the population and turn them against the religious minority in these provinces and States.",andrewyun7,andrewyun7_round5

We think that at the point in which they leave the country, that's to say Quebec or some other powerful state in the U.S. for example, leave that country and say ""we're not going to be part of your Federation anymore"", and we think that this is a very big harm, not a very likely one, but still in the realm of possibilities that exist in this debate, we think that this is terrible for the country as a whole, at the point in which your economic prosperity for every single citizen in your country is lured to an extent where you're stronger when you're together and you're weaker when you're separated.

244,244,116,constructive3,round5,82.0,5,"The second part I want to talk about is how we use ability to moderate that state or province in the future and in the indefinite future. Why? Because we give the perception that the federal government is against them, that they are under threat, which is by the way already some pretense that has already happened in the status quo at the point in which the Quebec provincial government is currently constantly saying, ""We are under threat with the English majority. We have to assert our wills and our political voice out there for us to survive and achieve all the benefits that we want to have.""

So in terms of the constitution, we say we protect Liberty, but that begs the question of what we understand what's Liberty to look like. This is a simple place he pay. That is to say, different cultures understand what religious freedom actually is supposed to mean. That is to say, [Lacey K 00:00:02:39], when we use that backdrop of neutrality is what is more conducive to freedom of consciousness. Right?

The symbol for some people, their life might be held. They can't proclaim their love for God from their rooftops every night. By contrast, there are some people for whom hearing that every night will make their life hell.

249,249,478,constructive6,round5,82.0,5,"I think there's one feedback to this is basically just that perhaps some cases we used to hurt only minorities, so I think if you look at wording of the wall that was in the context, it literally tells you that it fans all religious symbols, not specific symbols. Right? So all symbols are included. It doesn't matter whether you're in the majority or minority. I think there might be arguments about imperfect implementation, but again their side also doesn't solve this because it's about the texts, the law, not the implementation. So they wouldn't solve that issue either. I didn't know. I think the why for their laws that health freedom will curtail it equally for all other people, at least in the eyes of the law is necessarily because there are different religions, there are different parts of the overall constituency, which is there's always an incentive to have across the board rule, instead of just specifically targeting minorities because that is incredibly easy to call out.",elainehe,elainehe_round5

The reason why case law is uniquely better is necessarily because it actually sets a procedural justice course that people are more likely to buy into, even if they don't buy the outcome. Which is to say, even if they don't like the decision that the court constitutes, they still believe that the correct channels of justice were filled, which is why in the long run, they're more likely to actually see to this and not just in vigilante justice, which really gets uniquely worse than State centric nonviolence necessarily because all that lines gets blamed on the State anyway for not cutting those minorities.",elainehe,elainehe_round5

That's why there are religiously-based ethnic so status quo is just ruthless. But second, more importantly, if you actually care about pluralism, freedom of religion also implies freedom from religion. There presumably should also be a safe haven for people who are secularist that is on our side of the House. I don't think it's fair for us to...

I think this is most important because, when you have a source of housing, it's from there that you can begin to pursue the rest of your fulfillment in life. It's necessary to have this stable source of housing in order to seek employment, in order to be invested in your community. When you're renting, you're always subject to eviction notices from the landlords who are always pickled, who are always going to be increasing the rent as market rates change.

In particularly homogeneous minority areas in urban areas, public education is very poor due to the fact that these areas are labeled rough neighborhoods because of increased police presence due to the racial homogeneous of the area.

And what we see is that what these things are doing was creating studies and economic policies that were seen to be objective and scientific that instead of pushed sparkle policies like Progressive Tax Policy, ""freakoconomics"", ""stop and frisk""... All these harsh-on-crime, broken windows ideas that are in actuality very harmful to the emotions and the lived experience of individuals under this guise that is, instead, a very objective sense of policy, and that the facts are never wrong and that instead we should, that we should focus on these facts instead of the actual emotions and lived experiences of individuals... Because what's happening in politics, and the whole impact of politics in general, is going to impact not only human beings in, well let's say, economic wealth and everything, but also how they live their lives. And when we look at how people live their lives, it's heavily impacted by their mental state and their emotional system. So what's going to happen under the side of the status quo and this current narrative that we're writing, what's already happening is that people are losing their sense of humanity. They're being ""othered"" under this whole idea that we should look at people as numbers, as we look at statistics as being higher and more valuable than what actually happens in real life to the individuals that might not be able to be quantified numerically again.",ksbrown,ksbrown_round3

Especially when in Quebec, Christianity is the dominant religion, it has been for a long time.

So it doesn't just discriminate on that, so it doesn't just discriminate against certain religious groups, and it actually helps groups who are in a smaller position because what it does...so it removes religion from specifically from provincial employees. So these are people who are being exposed. They're usually in government positions, they're teachers, they're federal, they're provincial employees who work in the government. So these are people who have massive impact in the way that our society runs which we do not again want that to be based on religion. Teachers are literally...they're in a position where they have massive influence on the people the students that they are teaching. So what we don't want is from a very young age to expose them, to just especially when you're in a place where there is a dominant religion, to what religion. If we have a bunch of teachers who are all religious and they're all Christian, that's not that they expose people, and I think it actually forces religious view on something that should be a secular thing, like school.

They did not review this, which, so it probably would stand, which Anish brought up is saying that like, okay, all of these are reactive methods, right?

If you didn't, if you weren't able to go to preschool or kindergarten, then you're already behind. You didn't get to start learning math and start learning reading to the same level that other children did when you first get into school. So you're already disadvantaged when you start, you're already behind. And that carries out through your entire education because generally this is a geographical issue. Many of the people with these problems are in the same area and they're going to the same schools. So you have an entire school of kids who are behind because they didn't have these early childhood programs. And so these areas and these demographics of people aren't going to have the same opportunity to get to college as kids from better off areas. So when we fund these sorts of programs, we actually get this solid baseline education for these children. They're able to actually catch up in their education, they're able to have a higher quality of education and it equalizes the entire system, and it gives them a better chance of being able to go to college later on, right? Without this sort of funding for these sorts of programs, you simply don't get that, right? And especially in developing countries who are in so many cases, these programs simply do not exist. It's not like maybe you can't afford to go to them or something, it's they just don't exist. So with this type of funding, not only are you able to subsidize it for people who maybe can't afford it, you're also able to give that money to actually start having these programs in some places that don't have it. And so now kids who maybe people weren't able to send them to preschool or school at all in lots of areas of rural [00:02:56] they don't even have child labor laws, so they just send their kids to go work or work for the family or something like that.

For some reason, in the developed world, we've gotten into this mentality that like, Oh, if you don't have a college degree, you're worthless, and OO acknowledges this. They say that college is just a signaling mechanism and that's absolutely right. It has a lot of it, for a lot of cases it doesn't have much value. As they said, many people can do any job, right? So the college degree is just a barrier for them anyway. If you put more of the funding onto these early childhood programs, then you're giving less importance to the college education, right? Because you're putting the funding elsewhere, you're signaling that, Hey, this college education isn't as important, right? So now that you get this idea that the college education isn't as important from the signaling that it doesn't need the funding and it's not as important as the actual primary school in early childhood. Then you get to see that the college thing is just a signaling thing and you can get many jobs, and many important jobs, in our society that either don't require a college degree right now and are pivotal to society working just having jobs like being a janitor, or a plumber, or truck drivers or things or a lot of stuff like that. They're necessary for our society. But right now people see those jobs as being lesser and people who do those jobs as being lesser because they think that Oh, you couldn't afford a college education, or Oh, you weren't good enough for a college education. When you lessen the importance of a college education, then that mentality starts to go away. And then we can also get rid of some of the payment disparity because now we recognize that these people are just as pivotal in our society as the people who got a college degree, which doesn't do much, so they're actually able to be paid better because you have that new mentality that it's not only the college degree that makes you worthy as a person.

That subjective experiences won't be valued the same way. That you'll have small groups of people on one side who provide subjective experiences that won't be valued by the system that exists. What Niah tells you is that this objectivity doesn't exist, and in our side of the house, when we live in a world where subject subjectivity is valued, then we get a more... Where we systemically value subjective experiences, then political debates can be more diverse. They can be more truthful. They can be more real when we understand that everybody has subjective experiences that contribute to the truth. When we see one category of people as objective, when we see one category of one people who bring facts as objective, then we're harming the other people in the debate, who can tell other people that they are being subjective and thus less valued in the debate. That we can tell them that they're wrong because we are objective, when we are not. So next op tells you that objective truth is more important. In our world, objectivity is not what's valued in debate. In our world, subjectivity is valued in debate. And thus, we create a better world where everyone's experiences have the opportunity to be valued and cannot be masked under false objectivity. We see a world where subjectivity is actually valued and is not seen as something less than. We see emotional personal experiences of groups of people that are not seen as less than.

So, I think that what we see on our side of the house, is that when we have a system where that values subjectivity and we get more... The way we get more diversity in debates is because people who have the privilege to be objective, no longer have the only card to play in the debate. They can't undervalue people in the debate because they're being subjective, because they're affected by an experience. The subjective experience is therefore valued, and they can't just discount them because they're not being objective. We see that as a net good on our side of the house, because on our side of the house, we have the chance to value subjective experiences, which under the status quo are told as untrue, and are not valued because they're not objective. When the people who are telling them that they aren't objective have the power to be objective, because they're not actually affected by the outcome of the debates. Therefore, this is really problematical. When we see objectivity is not real, we see subjectivity is valued. Then we get a world where multiple opinions can exist at the same time and therefore we get better debates, we get better politics and then we get better emotions, better social good overall.

This is bad because when children are not exposed to this, once they are entered in public school, which is generally sort of lower quality because of the way that American public schools are funded by property taxes, so low income children already attend lower quality schools in the first place. But generally this is magnified because now by the time they get to these schools, once they're in kindergarten, when public school becomes free and the status quo, suddenly they've had much less exposure to socialization; they're less able to grow, interact with their peers, or learn cooperatively as opposed to state children in middle-class neighborhoods, or children who attend wealthy private schools, whose parents have already provided them something like daycare or nursery school, who are much better off.

This is why drop out rates are so abysmal - or rather- so high in low income areas right now. We sort of solve that for this by staring at the root cause, the children and feeling alienated and unfamiliar with school. It's just super important because one, this would lead to sort of better life outcomes, a more optimal target.

This looks like two things. In more vulnerable communities, the attention that they give to the children, is implicitly connected to their safety, because a parent needs to be very attentive to the child. That child needs to be safe, because a child cannot be at home alone in a neighborhood that is dangerous because the parents don't have the financial stability to move them into a safer neighborhood.

People have the incentive to set those prices higher because people are still willing to buy their insurance from this competitive market through the tax that government has placed.

525,525,9,constructive1,round3,78.0,3,"First one on extension is the broad scare of politics and the rant and the rise of right wing populism. The reason we like leftist opinions I think objectively and straight is because we think we're generally right about the world. We think that there is discrimination. We think there is sexism, we think there is all classism, but what structural aspects of personal narratives diffuse this, three. First, any argument against a personal narrative is then perceived as a personal attack. If you have someone whose objective, emotional experience is just like my family was attacked by immigrants and you're just like immigrants statistically don't really commit crime or the people, but, my family was attacked by immigrants. When you give that narrative the same emotional weight, comfortability and acceptance by like a swing voter who's just like, man, that statistic and like, God, I love this narrative. That is what results. If that's the case, then you get worse debate because you can't deflate narratives that are lies because you can't attack a narrative on its merits. It's in a narrative that you can't refute. Second, there's perceived as legitimately contested there. Unless you have a countervailing narrative. What this creates is a race to get the most marginalized person on your talk show. It's like, see if like one talk show comes up with like a Brown person is just like, this person thinks this about Trudeau's random black face or Brown face. And then the next conservative talk show, we'll try to find like Dinesh D'Souza to like say something about how Brown face is good and it creates like inclusionary politics because he's a conservative pack. The point is when you elevate people's personal identity to the level of elephant and cherry, et cetera, you get anyone who has a right to claim that identity, to be able to talk about that experience, to be able to say, this is what's going on, this is what I think is the case.

If my own personal experience and personal thoughts on the subject were given the same edit and share in weight as I study or objective argumentation, then I would have never been self critical in the first place because there's no mechanism. There's no narrative to tell me that debate is about putting stuff that I think about the world on the chopping block to see what people have to say about it. This is the highest probability impact because regardless of whatever mechanisms you think affect people's political discourse. Political debate is important because it encourages people to go through first, second, and third line responses to their positions. Anticipate the objections that they're talking about, deal with the research. If they have a study that disagrees with them, find another study, deal with the methodology of that study.

So having an individual talk about how they were treated in a specific instance is incredibly useful to starting a conversation, but it isn't necessarily useful to solving it. So for example, it is a completely reasonable question to ask of like given that we have disparities in educational outcomes for women versus men, for example. It is unclear where in the educational process that happens or what stage we need to like combat it, which policies are the most effective in order to reduce discrimination. These are things that you can't get from an individual story. You need to look at a big picture. Because some people are affected differently in order to get a sense of which policies are the most effective at combating these things. In order to figure out which policies are actually going to be able to have the most change given limited resources you necessarily need look at science and data. I think that if you just listen to emotional appeal, you don't necessarily get whole big picture ideas for how to solve issues and things will be solved based on ... if politicians can get away with saying they're going to solve things by appealing to emotion. So for example, Justin Trudeau can say that he values the environment. He can go to the Environmental March and appeal to emotion by saying that he cares and then spend billions of dollars on a pipeline. You can appeal to emotion and not have policy.

Not to limit this to the scope of the United States, but right now there's such high political polarization with our current president. With President Trump, people are really clashing. Studies have come out that people of different political ideologies actually just spend less time together, and that's a big thing.

We think that public discourse is a fine thing, but we think that emotions can lead people to do really extreme things that can put themselves in danger and actually not help them defend their cause. We also think that the really big issue in this is gridlock in legislation. A lot of times political discourse can lean to a divided Congress or a divided government, and because of that it can be very very difficult to pass meaningful legislation that actually attacks these issues. A lot of times important issues can be reviewed over and over again because there can be a divide in the government, and that can lead to a lot of difficulty in passing bills that actually attacks these.

People often hear things and become emotional about it, but that's not necessarily the truth. And we think that's detrimental. For example, let's just imagine a hypothetical.

578,578,52,constructive1,round2,78.0,3,"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?",pmanisca,pmanisca_round2
579,579,9,constructive1,round2,78.0,3,"Yes, it is true that most of these pressures are from norms. But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important.

Secondly, we believe, economically, you learn the skills and the trades you need to be a producer in a system that only values people for their production.

It's a case that the state's not doing a good enough job regulating the differences in early childhood development. Why is investing more money not going to solve this? For a couple of reasons. One, we believe the rich will always have more access to the levers of power to get better for their shoulder, no matter how much money you've probably spent in the system to equalize it. We believe the rich have better networks of access, no matter how much you give to lower income people. The families of the rich will always have the best nannies, the best healthcare services, the best, et cetera. But third, even when people get access to basic resources equally, there are still rich students get more of it because of the nature of capitalism, right? How do we solve back this educational inequality, these very foundational inequalities? The first is that the comparative is that there's no equality in a childcare system, no matter how much public funding goes towards it. But the second is that you get targeted spending across systems that are already meant to be more equal. So that's say you get more spending in the public education sector, you get more spending in trade schools, get more spending in... you get more spending in private health, private education systems.

I just told you the most important economic impact of this round is the student loan prices, but I leave the motion, but this one is going to go a little bit differently, right? We believe that the most important thing in this ground, then, is going to be what happens in the timeframe of a person's life when they progress out of their childhood years, and are no longer under the guise of their parents and they become individual agents.

How to write, how to engage in certain patterns of thoughts. When you fall behind in those developments, when you feel that you have difficulty reading in earlier grades, then you come to believe that you are bad at school and you have difficulty learning, and when you believe that you are not good at those things, there comes to be a cycle of self-validation where you believe you are not good at it, so you come to become worse at it. That does not happen in communities where children have more care applied to them because then, the narrative in poor communities is that a large amount of people are just not good enough and they are not made for this. They're not born for this, but in communities with the actual ability to afford that care, they are told that falling behind is not their faults and all they have to do is spend more time and have people spend more care upon them to actually catch up. While in poor communities, they are told that they cannot catch up because that's not who they are. We think that's a tragedy that can be fixed when we find things better and are able to provide better care. When we free parents to send their kids to better care or subsidized care such that parents can get better care.

Instead of cutting funding for early childhood education and forcing them to use the technology, like it's happening across the country and the world, we should push that to higher education where less touch is needed, and cut back on research that really isn't paying dividends.",djasson,djasson_round2

Because the reality is, even though we've started to see underrepresented people at universities, they are far outnumbered by a small minority of our society.

Why do emotional appeals obfuscate the responsibility of the political system and what is politically right? Why? Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.",djasson,djasson_round3

Needing to produce the best result, you need to pull together the most local information and how a reasoning that can be weighed and your emotional bandwidth is limited. So therefore, even if you can empathize with everyone, you can't keep up and emotional aspects of debate wear off far quicker than logical reasoning. We think fragmentation of experience means that emotions go both ways. That means again, if you feel very strongly about marginalized people in your country emotionally, well someone can feel the exact same way and the other way and it's a wash. We think that fragmentation of experience is also why there's not enough action on issues like gun control or climate change because everyone has only small experiences that don't pull together to the big picture, that only data and reasoning can explain.",djasson,djasson_round3

Whereas if you are able to diversify because you have skilled workers that provide unique contributions on the international stage, IE. you have skilled like tech designers that have startups, that provide unique service that can't be replaced, you have substantially more economic power.

We think that these strong resources that they've been given early and they're carried through to later parts of your life, which results in increased preparation for college and increased success when they're in college.

So our Subpoint A is that we can add readiness, we can have readiness after early childhood care is incredibly important, not just when students enter college, but also leading up to college. So throughout the entire primary and secondary education system, we also think that the educational benefits that they gained in early childhood education accrued through those years as well. So we think that early childhood education affects all 12 plus years of education. Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student.

Moreover, the parents who call hopefully don't have to do that much to support their students, but the parents of toddlers or young infants have a ton of burdens to fall on them. For example, they have to have the burden of starting a career, raising a child, and possibly taking care of their own parents and that ways, which means that support for a parents accrues exponentially in the longterm as well. And for example, if the parent of a young child has more support going into early childhood care and that allows them to be a better chance to start their own career running.

So now our second independent argument is that we think that our model closes educational inequities.

By not listening to those facts, we actually limit political discourse because now people are not able to talk about the root cause of the problems, which is actually what we need to address by just talking about facts.

In movies, in books, in various media sources, particularly the communists, it's usually white men who are writing these sources and their identities are portrayed as the norm to which other identities are, you compare that to this standard that is a centric to to a lot of media outlets.

We see their identity in the center as over-represented. So we believe that this is this narrative of them being objective just because it's seen as this overall standard. Moving into our second point of fundamentally why this is problematic. We see their experience portrayed an objective when nobody is objective, everybody is a sum of their life experiences, the interactions they have with other people in their lives, the events that they experience, their educational experiences. Everyone lived experiences and these things inform the kinds of political priorities people will pursue once they get into politics.

So it leads to a higher valuation of their experiences, which leads to better policy reform and more new wants to be, Cheryl People vote for people they think speak for their experiences. When the working class in America voted for Trump, who talked about America losing versus Hillary who would've had good policy for the working class but was seen as elitist. How does this get better at your side of the house? Well, we think that Trump got away with emotional appeals because he was seen as objective because of his white privilege and because of his high socioeconomic status he was able to talk with his issues and give out this illusion of I am looking at this subjectively from an expert opinion because of that privilege. That's not something that all people from marginalized communities get to use as a political tool. So yes. That's what we see on RSI. I said that I was on their side of the world. We have a world where people have lived, experiences are ignored while people who are usually the source of the problem that they are advocating for are seen as more legitimate because they're able to talk about these issues this passionately.

386,386,83,constructive1,round1,76.0,2,"And secondly, moving onto our two main points that kind of go together. There's currently a large socioeconomic stratification in housing. Because in addition to the racial differences of people that are in housing, the locational differences are extremely major too. When you have these large communities of houses, there usually just that. They're communities. They're in super large segregated areas. You have a lot of mansions all in one block versus the less expensive homes owned by poor communities are also all together. You have these really large differences in communities and people who live in these communities. And they're physically separated. We believe by promoting a tax that punishes people for owning wealthier homes, there's going to be less of a desire to buy wealthier homes. And a maybe a desire to sell your larger home and move to smaller one. As I said before, since this tax is punitive, I assume it would actually be effective in promoting the wealthy to downsize their homes.",rdames,rdames_round1
387,387,84,constructive2,round1,76.0,2,"With this moving to less expensive homes, you have more integration in terms of socioeconomic statuses because you will have them being able to move into homes where they... You will have the large communities that are largely segregated with wealthy homes downsizing and moving, being more integrated with communities of lower socioeconomic status, and you do... I understand that with downsizing your home still apply to people of lower socioeconomic incomes, but the stratification applies a lot more on the extremes than it does in the middle.",rdames,rdames_round1
388,388,85,constructive2,round1,76.0,2,"So you have the large mansion communities very separated, while you have the slightly smaller communities they are more closer to the rural lower socioeconomic status communities. I understand that this solution would not be perfect, but it would definitely help mitigate... No, thank you. Definitely help mitigate the problem. And this is very important for our mass problem. Why? Because the physical location matters significantly when it comes to schooling, which is our main effect that we bring to this debate, and how we see more integration and more progress over the long run.",rdames,rdames_round1
389,389,86,constructive3,round1,76.0,2,"Why is schooling super important to home ownership? Because public schooling... Sorry, I have to flip this. Public schooling is funded based on property tax. Property tax in a certain area, whether you're a high tax or a low tax, that is what is funding public schools. If you have people in an area of wealthier homes together very far away from an area of less wealthy homes together, the people who live by themselves segregated with the wealthy homes, they are going to have a lot more funding for their public schools.",rdames,rdames_round1
390,390,87,constructive3,round1,76.0,2,"When you have them moved closer together, you would have more equal opportunity schooling because the houses are closer together because there's more funding for these. What I mean is, when you have more people living in houses that are closer together and less completely segregated by wealth, their property taxes are being pooled together, so you have more equally funded schools. Of course, it would not be perfect, but it would definitely be significantly less stratify what you see today. With the extremely wealthy people going to school in some areas and poor people going to horrible public schools, particularly in cities and stuff like that. We believe this would create more opportunity because when the wealth disparity between public schools is lessened, the education quality that these students get is also... the disparity of quality is also lessened. So you have more access to better teachers for poor communities. You have, which I believe this is outside the scope of the debate, but preparedness for standardized tests in college, and creating more opportunities to succeed later in life.",rdames,rdames_round1

Basically, to do anything in them just because they are so much larger, they use a lot more energy, which is not great for the environment because they are pulling in more energy from the environment. And as global climate change is such a prevalent problem today, we would like to do things to prevent this from spreading further than it already has.

Look at a country like Thailand for example, which maybe the lot isn't worth that much, but the reason that that's the case is because they have political instability leading to economic instability. We say that we have solvency for that because it's not actually that they have a failing economic sector, as it is not that their businesses are failing, it's that due to their political instability, there is economic instability in the area. We say we provide stability to a place like Thailand, at the point of which you have more stability and a block of currency.

To comparatively better ... because if you look at the comparative right now it is good to have small amounts of inflation for investment, it is a race to the bottom at the point of which every country wants to inflate to try to get back their own investment, so now you just have hyperinflation getting the most out of investment.

That's what his objective analysis told him. Okay, so note that there's no such thing as objective policy.

Why do you think that there are a million think tanks, thousands of really smart people paid really highly to consider what reality looks like and thousands of scientists try to determine what the pictures of reality look like? It's because determining what the status quo looks like, what reality looks like, is fundamentally something that's very difficult. It's something that is debated over and the whole reason of having that debate is because putting together that picture of what reality looks like is so incredibly difficult. The fundamental belief of trying to actually attempt to get to this idea of there is this fundamental picture is something that is incredibly hard. Note, that if is going to argue that stats exist, the thing is that stats are just numbers that need to be interpreted. And the way in which they are interpreted is through personal experience, is through live experience, is through contextualization, because the numbers themselves don't tell you anything. For example, dudes like Trump has a higher employment percentage than Obama and that's something told you by Republicans. There needs to be contextualization around why that number is. For example, like that number was rising during Obama's era and continued into Trump's. That contextualization is needed to understand what the picture is and how do you contextualize those stats is the reason why those lived experiences are necessary?",samuelwu,samuelwu_round3
400,400,32,constructive3,round3,76.0,2,"Okay, so now we're going to the meat of this on what is the harm to actually attempting to be objective? Because note that attempting to be objective and attempting to make a creative view in which you are objective means that you are trying and you convince yourself that you are succeeding, is actually creating a truth for yourself. Now that you believe that your view is probably the truth is probably correct that's what, for most people, what trying to be objective actually looks like. You don't realize that your own experiences, that the staff that you see, the facts that you see are still only your subjective view and you are viewing the window through a lens of your experiences still. We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right. And that was the narrative given by society that was propagated as the truth. That's the one you run into.

In our world we think that when you reject the idea that there needs to be an untruth to be had, a truth to delved into, then what happens is that this is a world that is fundamentally more accepting of different viewpoints. This is a world where you are actually better able to accept different viewpoints and actually have a more contextualization of the world in which you live in. It's a world in which people are better able to come to policies, ironically, because you are better able to come to terms with people's actual experiences. You are able to understand people's experiences more because you have no idea, no conception of trying to reach this truth because you understand that your experiences are only simply a subset of those that exist in society.

This is one of the most common ways you can start your drug operation or any kind of a criminal organization because they're never checked in on and the police don't go there because they're vacant.

Consumers are vastly irrational when it comes to housing in a couple of ways.

Secondarily it means that when you have that something that increases prices or decreases jobs, that just some kind of a small recession that would cause people to default on their mortgages, those people that would default on their mortgages, instead just have to move to a lower cost rental home. That is, they never incur the debt and they never cause lenders to default, which is what causes these housing crashes in the first place.",thecactus,thecactus_round1

We think the amount of, the chances are that a poor person is going to own a house, is very low. They are more likely to rent. They're living hand to mouth. When they go to work, they get their pay check they send it in to a place that gives them money instantly, they can't even wait for the deposit in the bank, and they go and they pay the rent. We think these are not the people this is going to help. We think they are more helped under the mechanism that gives you. We lower overall prices.",zbense,zbense_round1

We'll tell you, one, why maybe those housing prices are better, under our side of the house. But second of all even, even if you have to bite the arm of them having to pay more to own the house they want to live in, we think they're going to get that money back in other aspects of the housing market. When that housing market goes down, and they can make it so personal ownership is passed, but corporate ownership is less. I want to talk about that later.",zbense,zbense_round1

This can be seen because if you look at the difference in value of qualitative and quantitative reasoning, qualitative and quantitative data or approaches to reasoning. So the mechanism is as follows. If feelings or subjective experiences are acquired, then you gather more rich and thick descriptions of a phenomenon that consequently better inform you to make policy. There are a variety of different problems and solutions that were derived in the world and that have come out of political debates that simply could not be informed by objective fact. If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world. A very good example of this is a study that was conducted and had qualitative methods that were used, focused on subjective feelings, about what the impact for Asian American immigrants was coming to United States. And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics? And you cannot answer that question by looking at objective fact. That is way too narrow and reductionist. So instead, what was done and which effectively proves the argument that we're trying to make today is, instead what happened was interviews were conducted, shared experiences were shared, and from that, a whole rich, thick set of data came out, and consequently informed in how to better, in an informing way, of us understanding the true impact of, for example, segregation and assimilation on Asian American immigrants. Now this is a very broad example and to connect it back to the resolution, I want to talk about its impact. So the impact of this greater idea of subjective experiences and feelings provide a whole more holistic understanding of policy, and therefore are important in a debate and that's why we regret it. The impact can be seen simply, for one, by looking at the comparative. So if these feelings and subjective feelings were excluded from this debate, then we simply would not have insight into feelings of, specifically in this case and which can be seen on a more broad scale, marginalized communities.",zoejohnson,zoejohnson_round3

In a way that might undermine your rights in those religious groups because they have less political capital, they have less people collaborating with them and so on and so forth. But I also think that there is a very real pragmatic argument about what effects on the ground are we how people react to that minority and how people react to the federal government. So Colin gave you this argument about how people would hate on the minority group because they are perceived as the group that drains on the resources of the state. They're response here is ah, well the state is going to change their ways so they can get more money. I think oftentimes there are extremist cultural practices all the time that they talk about such that the calculation isn't pragmatic to begin with it's not based on that. I haven't seen a budget, no thanks.",lorenpf1,lorenpf1_round5
613,613,642,constructive2,round5,83.0,6,"But even if it is, it often times comes after feeling some sort of brunt from the lack of economic success. So maybe you go for two years and your state gets more soft and then you change your ways. We said if this is still enough for them to have significant resentment against particular minority groups, but more over, I think that there is likely to be some substantial backlash against the federal government. That is to say, a lot of people in these states are going to feel aggrieved that the federal government has been unwilling to support them or has been willing to intervene in this particular way. So we think that for the anti-religious groups that you're talking about. They're likely to become a more extremist and more people in those states who may entice particularly religious but are aggressively in favor of the independence of states, now move their political attack. Not to be on the state level, but to be on the government level that way. The possibility isn't that we get less respect for religious liberty at the state level, but it is that there is a change in federal policy.",lorenpf1,lorenpf1_round5

We think that Vietnam and Malaysia and countries like this are on the brink of economic growth and are developing extremely quickly. When this happens, they should be practicing policies that probably put them in debt. We think that for countries like these explicitly inflation is really good because it creates liquidity immediately. What this means, is that to explode, they need to be spending on infrastructure, they need to be spending on things that will actually support their population when they finally reach the economic level that they are trying to reach.

They're more likely to give you, you think they're more likely to give you money. What this actually looks like is giving Singapore an incredible opportunity to start doing things like predatory lending, like holding Malaysia accountable when they've paid for their roads or trains or whatever it is. Being that Singapore is really likely to use this as a bargaining chip for the rest of time, and this is probably really bad for those under developing countries. We also think that this leads to less humanitarian aid and things like that, that are specifically going to come from the IMF because the IMF is the only actor that has a reason to care about those sorts of things being implemented",susieg,susieg_round4

When we failed at Greece, maybe the tension between Germany and Greece eventually went away, but you know what also went away? Britain. We think it's really, really bad that when countries who are doing a lot of holding up the weaker countries get angry and leave those sorts of coalitions, it's really bad politically, but also can horrible, horrible effects on currency like this specifically. We think that countries like Singapore and like China get really tired of supporting economies that aren't doing what they want them to do whether or not its actually good for those countries. We think that when Singapore sees that Thailand's not growing to the extent that they thought they originally would because of the austerity measures they've imposed, they're probably not going to want to stick to a coalition that's hurting them in the long run.

First of all, we have to have a mobile population for economic interconnectedness to actually work. This looks like a couple of things. First of all it looks like people being able to actually go where the jobs are in order to reap the benefits of any sort of economic growth. This doesn't happen when it's literally a region composed of islands separated by massive bodies of water and also crazy inherent cultural differences. We already think it's pretty unlikely that Malaysia is going to get along really well with Vietnam or Thailand, so we think that we're to create any real interconnectedness when people can't travel between the two nations and have no reason to overcome the differences that already exist there.",susieg,susieg_round4
