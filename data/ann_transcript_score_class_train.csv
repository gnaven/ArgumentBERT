But I think in all other instances the Supreme Court has fucked over religious minorities. What does this look like? Native Americans saying they want to do a safe drug because it's part of their faith and the Government saying no. Despite not actually having allowing Native Americans to do Peyote. So basically just a big fuck you to religious minorities even though they have no reason not to protect them.

Think about something like when we tried to change the drinking age to 21 many states refused to accept this money... they denied the money because they didn't want to change the cultural norms. Or Obama Care. Many people refused to accept this because they didn't want to pick off their culture and autonomy because think this threats. So what happens is the programs that help the least well off like Education, Healthcare, and Transport gets cut so the best off, in their scenario, can still access these benefits in other ways but the people who need the government to provide them get fucked. Especially because who are Then we say generally, I think Government over relies on the idea that we should rest and value religious freedom, apply them to instances that help.

That is to say, the rhetoric that is used when you are talking about why we should allow immigrants into the country is often based on the rhetoric of, for example, losing access to jobs that you think are going to be replaced by these groups of people. We see a world in which we create immediate pressure on the working-class people that vote for xenophobic policies by directly taking away the resources that they often need, they realize that their politicians that they voted for largely on an economic basis are probably lying to them in this regard and they're also likely, at least in some states that question the policies that they're dealing with.

6,6,347," Firstly, we say that subjective experiences often neglect to show whole pictures of problems and get to questions of solvency. So having an individual talk about how they were treated in a specific instance is incredibly useful to starting a conversation, but it isn't necessarily useful to solving it. So for example, it is a completely reasonable question to ask of like given that we have disparities in educational outcomes for women versus men, for example. It is unclear where in the educational process that happens or what stage we need to like combat it, which policies are the most effective in order to reduce discrimination. These are things that you can't get from an individual story. You need to look at a big picture. Because some people are affected differently in order to get a sense of which policies are the most effective at combating these things. In order to figure out which policies are actually going to be able to have the most change given limited resources you necessarily need look at science and data. I think that if you just listen to emotional appeal, you don't necessarily get whole big picture ideas for how to solve issues and things will be solved based on ... if politicians can get away with saying they're going to solve things by appealing to emotion. So for example, Justin Trudeau can say that he values the environment. He can go to the Environmental March and appeal to emotion by saying that he cares and then spend billions of dollars on a pipeline. You can appeal to emotion and not have policy. We'd our side that you actually need to prove that your policies work and that they are effective. You can't just lie to voters.

7,7,348,"In terms of unity, we say that it's harder to represent large groups of people that would otherwise be united because experience is tied to identity. That is to say, we say the indigenous people that have their lands taken by coal miners and also the people that work in coal mines and die of black lung in the hundreds of thousands are often united on goals like reducing coal mining, which is bad for both of them. But they're often divided by emotional ideologies. Let's say that you can only vote for people that have similar backgrounds to you. We would say this means that voter turnout is much lower when you have coalitions. For example, the democratic party in the United States where you're representing hundreds of completely diverse backgrounds where you can only represent one singular politician and they are almost certainly not going to build or represent everyone. When you have objective fact, you can see how these issues are related to each other on a broad scale. How it affects tons of different people, and you get substantially more voter turnout and unity, which means you're not divided when you're fighting against the rich and powerful",constructive2,jacobsilcoff,round3,78.0,3
8,8,355,"We still... You still have emotions. We can have unideal debates, and we cannot coerce people who abandon any sort emotional appeal. thinks that there's a degree of political capital that happens when you're either running for office, or simply discussing an issue on Facebook. And for that, what we want to do is make sure that people counter question any item of discussion that happens, right? Like when, Ben Shapiro Gordon's aspects they'll care about your feelings. What I want to do is... I want to research to prove his facts wrong, because that way can actually establish that my world view was more accurate; through the actual questioning of the world rather than his personal lived experiences. Essentially, that's the same case that happens at any outright debate, and in left wing debate. We push for practically... Push for understanding. So, what does the study school, Marco? Let's talk about the good, because we think the good is people doing research. We think that is the kind of world that we'd like to continue living under. But what is the bad about the study school? The bad happens when politics become more emotionally guided, than faculty guided. So, here's a few examples, right? We think firstly politics can be entrenched, right? That means when people are entrenched, pooled their political bias. Like, If I'm a Republican; I will forever vote Republican. Or, if I'm in Canada, I vote for the greens; then I'm like super environmentalist. I am entrenched to that, because it is my fundamental political belief that the environment is a priority. I refuse to consider arguments from other parties that might question this solvency, or question the efficacy of my own policies, right? So, on that basis, we're left in a position where we're stuck within our lines, right? The second thing that can happen is positions can be unfounded. Flat air researches, flat earthers, and like Brexit supporters, and all of these crazy policies that have been enacted as so far. Or, crazy beliefs that have been held are held in emotional driven circumstances, right? It is a skepticism of the things that you're told, or it is a thin, feverish like hatred of different minority groups. Or, hatred of the establishment that leads people to these positions that are inherently unfounded. They are justified only because, they are rejecting the political debate, and it manifests like them rejecting the media as fake news and it manifests has done like rejecting the political discussion. The research that scientists have about global warming, about how it is a certainty, right? It is projecting the objective truths of our debate, that still happened in the study school. Because of this projection of truths, we have people that are not necessarily engaging in the world. The role of narrative, as I said before, therefore; is to push for questioning. To push for one accuracy of political belief. Like actually what is the accuracy of the policy or the belief that you're holding, right? Like, is it actually substantiated in the real world? And likewise, to question the leaders that come to us, right? Like when, Donald Trump, comes to office... I would have liked it to be all right, to question the efficacy of his policies. To question, the efficacy of the wall, or to question the efficacy of this spending NATO. Cause if we had his voter base, have this narrative in their back of their head rather than the hatred of the establishment, we would've had a different election. But the same thing in upcoming elections throughout the world, we want people to actually question what the politicians are saying and whether it's actually valid, right? So, what do we get without it? Three key aspects here: first of all, we get better voting if we still have the narrative in place. Without it; we get worse voting, because we have populism rising throughout the world. For example, in Europe we have many, many parties that are super right wing, like the alternative for Germany, your Marine Le pen. Essentially, they are advocating for a new kind of world",constructive1,idonotad,round3,78.0,3
9,9,368,"First one on extension is the broad scare of politics and the rant and the rise of right wing populism. The reason we like leftist opinions I think objectively and straight is because we think we're generally right about the world. We think that there is discrimination. We think there is sexism, we think there is all classism, but what structural aspects of personal narratives diffuse this, three. First, any argument against a personal narrative is then perceived as a personal attack. If you have someone whose objective, emotional experience is just like my family was attacked by immigrants and you're just like immigrants statistically don't really commit crime or the people, but, my family was attacked by immigrants. When you give that narrative the same emotional weight, comfortability and acceptance by like a swing voter who's just like, man, that statistic and like, God, I love this narrative. That is what results. If that's the case, then you get worse debate because you can't deflate narratives that are lies because you can't attack a narrative on its merits. It's in a narrative that you can't refute. Second, there's perceived as legitimately contested there. Unless you have a countervailing narrative. What this creates is a race to get the most marginalized person on your talk show. It's like, see if like one talk show comes up with like a Brown person is just like, this person thinks this about Trudeau's random black face or Brown face. And then the next conservative talk show, we'll try to find like Dinesh D'Souza to like say something about how Brown face is good and it creates like inclusionary politics because he's a conservative pack. The point is when you elevate people's personal identity to the level of elephant and cherry, et cetera, you get anyone who has a right to claim that identity, to be able to talk about that experience, to be able to say, this is what's going on, this is what I think is the case. The impact of this is diffusing the ability to adequately consider political opinions in meaningful manner. This is what really affects people at the margins. This is what really affects people who want to come in.",constructive1,ishanbhatt,round3,78.0,3
10,10,369,"The second extension we're going to give you is that their side of the house regardless of what effect you think it has on the political sphere, well wreck debates self critical value. Debate is important because not everyone is right with the opinions that they go in, walking into the debate. I had been wrong so many times in debate and it's because of my personal license. If my own personal experience and personal thoughts on the subject were given the same edit and share in weight as I study or objective argumentation, then I would have never been self critical in the first place because there's no mechanism. There's no narrative to tell me that debate is about putting stuff that I think about the world on the chopping block to see what people have to say about it. This is the highest probability impact because regardless of whatever mechanisms you think affect people's political discourse. Political debate is important because it encourages people to go through first, second, and third line responses to their positions. Anticipate the objections that they're talking about, deal with the research. If they have a study that disagrees with them, find another study, deal with the methodology of that study. It is that objected incentive that creates debates over political institutions in a meaningful manner. Starting at the level of identity means stopping at the level of identity.",constructive2,ishanbhatt,round3,78.0,3
11,11,370,"Our first contention is that political polarization plagues relationships. Right? This is all over the world. It can be toxic for family friendships and other communities that otherwise would be healthy without the political discourse. 
What does this look like? Thanksgiving dinners that are stopped, and I know that that's in America but all around the world, family gatherings and holidays that are stopped congregating because people have different things that keep them from interacting which stops friendships. People don't want to hang out with their friends if they think that the politics are going to come into that friendship and really just have such a big impact that it's hard to spend time together.
So why is this important? We think that it weakens unity just among people and everyone. If a lot of different people are clashing on these issues, we think that it creates a less united world. Not to limit this to the scope of the United States, but right now there's such high political polarization with our current president. With President Trump, people are really clashing. Studies have come out that people of different political ideologies actually just spend less time together, and that's a big thing.
Also, why is this important? What's the impact of having this? People divided, it leads to a lot of protests. If there are these emotions, people feel really encouraged and the other side, brought up movements like Black Lives Matter and school shooting responses. We think those are really important but we also think that violent protests sometimes can lead to the loss of life and can lead to people really being harmed and injured. We see these violent protests in China and South Africa right now over different things. We think sometimes emotions can overtake people to really protest and to the extent to where they can get damaged. We think that public discourse is a fine thing, but we think that emotions can lead people to do really extreme things that can put themselves in danger and actually not help them defend their cause. We also think that the really big issue in this is gridlock in legislation. A lot of times political discourse can lean to a divided Congress or a divided government, and because of that it can be very very difficult to pass meaningful legislation that actually attacks these issues. A lot of times important issues can be reviewed over and over again because there can be a divide in the government, and that can lead to a lot of difficulty in passing bills that actually attacks these. Whereas if it's all subjective, people can just quarrel. And also over issues that aren't even political, just because they're divided in general it can lead to harder passage of that.",constructive1,mswan,round3,78.0,3
12,12,371,"Our second main contention is that objectivity makes sense as it is more fact-based and people have different levels of emotional experience and bias. So it's going to be difficult for two people who have had like vastly, vastly different levels of emotional experience to talk about politics and objectivity is a more effective way to do that. If someone has had all this huge background and someone doesn't have that big of a background knowing about these politics, I think that conversation is going to be really hard. But if it's mainly objective and we recognize the facts in the lace, then that will be credible, and about facts, right? You see even the speech after all these political speakers, there are fact checkers and the speeds come on and a lot of times what they say is false. I think people often blom onto that and I think if there was more objectivity, things would be fact-based and decisions would be made off what is true instead of what people hear. People often hear things and become emotional about it, but that's not necessarily the truth. And we think that's detrimental. For example, let's just imagine a hypothetical. Somebody grew up in a family that was racist, right? You grow up in a family that your parents do not like people of a different color, right? And then you grow up thinking that and you see a candidate who is very qualified but they fit that bill of being a different race and you don't support them because of your family bias. Right? People are inherently tethered to biases that they grow up with. And we think that leads to them skewing opinions when it could be they're ignoring the facts. We also can think someone got screwed over by a company, right? And then there's a candidate running who used to work in that company too, and they're not going to support them even if they're qualified just because their personal experiences hold them back.",constructive2,mswan,round3,78.0,3
13,13,445,"That is unlikely to happen when people, rich people, still own votes. They still own like other types of assets that are not in the form of housing. That means that this kind of wealth tax is unlikely to threaten them very much, especially when they value something like the idea of the white picket fence image of being an American or being a wealthy person. In almost any country in the world of owning your own property, right? So I don't think that's something they're likely to give up. We are not likely to meaningfully unseat rich people from properties, even sometimes if they don't already live in right? It's a status symbol in society. And I don't think that's something that disappears. But even if we do, this doesn't solve broader health inequality because even if we improve housing to a small degree, we still have massive systems of inequality that mean that some people are locked out of opportunity.",constructive1,miclew,round1,78.0,3
14,14,446,"But I think additionally, there's no reason to believe that this tax money, as I mentioned earlier, is going to go where they say it will. But okay, now and buy renting gets worse. So rich people, as I mentioned, are still going to be able to afford to manage this task because of other assets that they have. And because of how much they value the status of having this kind of home, this means that the kinds of people who are impacted by this are low and mid-income people who will need to resort to renting on the comparative, right? They say the state is going to allow you to sell your house then fine. Maybe that happens, right? But that means that these people are stuck having to either be homeless or more likely renting in most cases, right? This is likely to make the market for renting far worse when landlords now know that they have a wider market of people who are constrained to renting, right?",constructive1,miclew,round1,78.0,3
15,15,448,"But the problem is it doesn't matter when the landlords can abuse tenants because there's lack of alternatives for these tenants on where else to live, right? This means that people's lives get worse there. They live in moldy houses that are not cared for. They find right now they don't get any services they require. They end up living in a far worse situation that allows them to not focus on other areas of their lives but instead worry about the fundamental things that, Oh gee thought we needed to protect.

16,16,449,"Or more people who are forced into far less quality housing. Because when there isn't this competitive competition to keep rent prices down, that's very . I think that the political welfare things like mind control, that's what they're going to say is very limited. So I would say that what's likely to happen is to at least a certain extent, things get quite a bit more expensive for people, they can't afford other things. They can't afford to invest. They are likely to be in a higher degree poverty. Right? But on stability, this is leading into that, right? So I think when you own a home, you take out mortgage, that's an asset you can use to get loans to assert your financial stability when it comes to proving up, also to be able to take out that money and invest in things if you so choose to lift yourself.",constructive1,miclew,round1,78.0,3

And they often come from wealthy families, can be supported by other members of their family have generational wealth that they're sitting on, but okay, the impacts of this are two-fold, right?

18,18,469,"But now moving on to our own positive case is we're going to analyze another stakeholder that are homeowners themselves and how the housing market, the home worship, ends up being more harmful for the world. Living in the United States of America under the ambit of the American dream where home ownership is the most fundamental way to gain environmental stability, we believe that this illusion has forced a lot of poor people, a lot of middle class people, into area, into situation they did not want to be in the first place.",constructive1,kamilaslam,round1,78.0,3

And these additional expenses over the years form a huge burden for these individuals.

People spend their entire lives living in Even in these United States, people prefer housing. People prefer spending more in houses than in any other things. People have houses in more than two States. So this is why there's an incentive for the State to make sure they a curb down. The fact that they're spending most of their life savings on housing, takes them away from spending that money that could've been better spent.

Everything, this is something that as a government, we should curb down on just because we want to make sure that people are spending the money in the right way. And that's not something that is isolated just this case because State does interfere whenever consumers are being harmed. State tax tobacco for instance.

But the third reason here, why this is so important, why it's so pernicious that we bring you, is that there's no accountability mechanism for courts.

It's more likely the case that I get upset at the people who are in charge of the leaders of power that somebody has no access to it.

So that is to say, you won't have the radical version of populism, which denies people rights without having states that also deny people rights.

50,50,715,"Okay, so on to themes. So first of all, what is objectivity? So, alt brings you the argument that objective experiences won't be valued. That subjective experiences won't be valued the same way. That you'll have small groups of people on one side who provide subjective experiences that won't be valued by the system that exists. What Niah tells you is that this objectivity doesn't exist, and in our side of the house, when we live in a world where subject subjectivity is valued, then we get a more... Where we systemically value subjective experiences, then political debates can be more diverse. They can be more truthful. They can be more real when we understand that everybody has subjective experiences that contribute to the truth. When we see one category of people as objective, when we see one category of one people who bring facts as objective, then we're harming the other people in the debate, who can tell other people that they are being subjective and thus less valued in the debate. That we can tell them that they're wrong because we are objective, when we are not. So next op tells you that objective truth is more important. In our world, objectivity is not what's valued in debate. In our world, subjectivity is valued in debate. And thus, we create a better world where everyone's experiences have the opportunity to be valued and cannot be masked under false objectivity. We see a world where subjectivity is actually valued and is not seen as something less than. We see emotional personal experiences of groups of people that are not seen as less than. Because under our current, under the status quo, objectivity, which is really just a collection of personal experiences of the people in power, is seen as more than because it can be labeled as objective",constructive1,alexsteele32,round3,78.0,3
51,51,716,"So in your world, the only people who have the opportunity to be objective, are those in power who have the privilege to not be emotional. The only people who have the privilege not to be emotional in political debates, are those who are not actually affected by them. No thanks.
So, I think that what we see on our side of the house, is that when we have a system where that values subjectivity and we get more... The way we get more diversity in debates is because people who have the privilege to be objective, no longer have the only card to play in the debate. They can't undervalue people in the debate because they're being subjective, because they're affected by an experience. The subjective experience is therefore valued, and they can't just discount them because they're not being objective. We see that as a net good on our side of the house, because on our side of the house, we have the chance to value subjective experiences, which under the status quo are told as untrue, and are not valued because they're not objective. When the people who are telling them that they aren't objective have the power to be objective, because they're not actually affected by the outcome of the debates. Therefore, this is really problematical. When we see objectivity is not real, we see subjectivity is valued. Then we get a world where multiple opinions can exist at the same time and therefore we get better debates, we get better politics and then we get better emotions, better social good overall. Because we don't see objective objectivity as the only answer. And thus, we can value people who are outside of that norm.",constructive2,alexsteele32,round3,78.0,3
52,52,791,"Basically, we're going to argue that women are unfairly burdened with child care, and as a result the state must step in to correct this wrong. So there are three reasons why women are unfairly burdened with child care. The first is societal norms on how men and women in a heteronormative relationships interact. Women are viewed as the caretakers, and men are viewed as the breadwinners. As a result of this societal norm, there's often a push for women to become the mother and take on the primary responsibility of the child. In this case, it is most likely to be child care. This looks like that parent leaving their job, going back home, and helping their child live and succeed. Note that when a mother has a option, or when there exists no option for child care, and it's the choice between either the mother and the father staying home, often it's going to be the mother staying home as a result of these norms when there's no child care available. But secondly, we also believe that men just abandoned children with mothers. There is a horrible problem of humans where men will have sex with a woman and then leave her, and then that child is alone with the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you.

59,59,37,"So we just think that's something that just falls on So now I'm getting into our extension point years. So why is the federal government the most important actor and the best actor to prevent the infringement of religious Liberty? So the federal government is the best actor to change this because while there do exist state and provincial differences in values, there are the ultimate guards of the constitution of the state and thus have the right to remove funding from dissident States.

They have the right to impose the general civil liberties that are given by the constitution of the state that is accepted by all the members of that state, and therefore absolutely have the right to refuse giving funding, state funding to some national States that do not align with the federal protected liberties of a certain state. So why this action on the part of the federal government will be the most effective in preventing infringement on religious liberties. We think that sub-national governments cannot operate without federal funding in the federal state. And therefore when the federal government misjudges on what is not allowed in the infringement of our religious beliefs, they are the best actor to do so. They are the best actor to ensure that civil liberties are protected when it comes to especially religious identities.

So there is a long standing understanding that the state should not assert themselves in affairs and personal beliefs, such as religious beliefs. And by the federal government suspending funding, they are able to assure that States are not asserting themselves in affairs that do not belong to the state. So it's a longstanding agreement between the state and its citizens that it doesn't meddle in the... Assert itself in personal affairs and by a state saying that they have the right to infringe upon religious liberties of particularly minority religions with the state, then that's accepting that state power can go beyond the scope of what is given by the citizens that allow it to operate.

Look at a country like Thailand for example, which maybe the lot isn't worth that much, but the reason that that's the case is because they have political instability leading to economic instability. We say that we have solvency for that because it's not actually that they have a failing economic sector, as it is not that their businesses are failing, it's that due to their political instability, there is economic instability in the area.

So there are countries in the Middle East that have tons of oil, but literally just 12 qualified petroleum engineers. Which means that even though they have tons of oil, they can't extract it efficiently or sell it on the global stage in a way that makes their country as much money as possible. We said that often, this leads to relying on things like manipulative actual corporations that come in and provide this human capital for you at massive expense, often taking huge advantage of resources that should otherwise belong in your country.",constructive1,jacobsilcoff,round2,76.0,2

So it's much more efficient to invest in things like teachers that will be able to immediately educate people and increase their skills so that they can start businesses that hire tons of people or invest in the doctors that can save lives and massively increase their economy.

One, they're incredibly susceptible to changes in that economy. With oil crashes, your entire economy is fucked. Right? Whereas if you are able to diversify because you have skilled workers that provide unique contributions on the international stage, IE. you have skilled like tech designers that have startups, that provide unique service that can't be replaced, you have substantially more economic power.

That is to say, these companies will be able to invest in countries especially if they can build early education things if they see that country can prove itself in their ability to have skilled laborers that can do these jobs that are increasingly in demand on our international economy.

Because in addition to the racial differences of people that are in housing, the locational differences are extremely major too. When you have these large communities of houses, there usually just that. They're communities. They're in super large segregated areas. You have a lot of mansions all in one block versus the less expensive homes owned by poor communities are also all together. You have these really large differences in communities and people who live in these communities. And they're physically separated. We believe by promoting a tax that punishes people for owning wealthier homes, there's going to be less of a desire to buy wealthier homes. And a maybe a desire to sell your larger home and move to smaller one. As I said before, since this tax is punitive, I assume it would actually be effective in promoting the wealthy to downsize their homes.",constructive1,rdames,round1,76.0,2

Property tax in a certain area, whether you're a high tax or a low tax, that is what is funding public schools. If you have people in an area of wealthier homes together very far away from an area of less wealthy homes together, the people who live by themselves segregated with the wealthy homes, they are going to have a lot more funding for their public schools.",constructive3,rdames,round1,76.0,2

What I mean is, when you have more people living in houses that are closer together and less completely segregated by wealth, their property taxes are being pooled together, so you have more equally funded schools. Of course, it would not be perfect, but it would definitely be significantly less stratify what you see today. With the extremely wealthy people going to school in some areas and poor people going to horrible public schools, particularly in cities and stuff like that. We believe this would create more opportunity because when the wealth disparity between public schools is lessened, the education quality that these students get is also... the disparity of quality is also lessened.

112,112,329,"Secondarily, it has the impact on crime. Vacant homes disproportionately increase crime rates in areas. A couple of reasons. One, vacant homes function as a literal location to conduct crime. Last week there was a drug bust in Ohio that was a vacant home that somebody owned, people have there and started cooking meth. This is one of the most common ways you can start your drug operation or any kind of a criminal organization because they're never checked in on and the police don't go there because they're vacant. Secondarily, they function as targets or vandalism and the vandalism creates an optic effect of crime that encourages other vandals and other criminals to be more active in the area.

Why is it good to encourage them to instead be renting? A couple of reasons. The first reason is that it mitigates housing bubbles. Consumers are vastly irrational when it comes to housing in a couple of ways. For one, opening opposition already tells us that people tend to be unaware of other investment opportunities besides housing. That means if they have money and want to invest, they default to housing even if it's not a wise investment.",constructive3,thecactus,round1,76.0,2
114,114,331,"Secondarily, you think people are very bad at estimating economic growth.

115,115,332,"Why did affect the housing bubble? A couple of ways. The first is it actually prevents housing crashes in the first place. That is, people are no longer buying homes when they can't afford them because those people on the margin who do not have the capital to be able to afford the home, and would only be buying a few things like securitized loans, are no longer able to go afford it and instead opt to rent homes instead. Secondarily it means that when you have that something that increases prices or decreases jobs, that just some kind of a small recession that would cause people to default on their mortgages, those people that would default on their mortgages, instead just have to move to a lower cost rental home. That is, they never incur the debt and they never cause lenders to default, which is what causes these housing crashes in the first place.",constructive4,thecactus,round1,76.0,2
116,116,333,"That's why we're not actually getting these kinds of recessions in the first place. This is the single biggest impact in the round. Why is this the biggest impact in the round and not just a niche impact? Once, we tell you the recessions were inevitable and cyclical. They're going to happen, but secondarily we tell you that when they happen, the frequency with which they happen is more common than the length of time that people own a home, i.e. you might own a home for 30 years, but a recession might happen every 10 years. So we can reasonably expect that a recession is going to hit the home that you own and finally when this does happens, this has the potential to completely erase all of your wealth. If we believe, oh, oh, the majority of your intergenerational wealth is held in your home, then we say that that wealth is going to be eliminated when the inevitable recession hits.",constructive4,thecactus,round1,76.0,2
117,117,334,"But secondarily, when the recessions do hit, it makes them less severe because even if you still have a housing crash, now those people on the margin do not own the home or aren't exposed to the housing crash and therefore are not going to have their savings wiped out, are not going to have their credit score prevents them from renting in the future.

118,118,349,"So the rebuilding and I hope closing opposition understands their case a little more because it seems like they don't by those POIs. Why is objectivity alive? Why these weaponizing counter narratives not the biggest issue that we're facing? Because first, I think that normative policy over increasing statistics is going to become a new norm. Notably a lot of policy is made by the rich and wealthy and racial majorities. Meaning, if they are able to just keep using those statistics, keep saying, ""Let's increase our efficiency from 30% to 35%,"" and that is the only angle in which they're trying to achieve, this is particularly harmful because they're easily able to ignore all the minority populations that are also affected by these policies. What changes our government? We think that there was no statistic ever to suggest that having minority liberation and integrating a more inclusive workspace and having more inclusive hiring practices at all ever suggested that we've increased efficiency. In a world of objectivity, that would never be a play, but when individuals are able to talk out and say, I think inclusivity is important. My lived experiences of being marginalized have been very harmful for me to get into the workplace, then I think then policy is going to change in a different way in which we no longer care about increasing efficiency. We are now turning towards a world in which we ought believe it should be. Statistics can't tell us how we should go about that number. If we just try to increase efficiency, but using lived experiences allows us to contextualize what world we want to live in, not just how do we increase efficiency. I think that is incredibly important. This is why stories help the contextualization of our messages. This is why the minority populations are already... Blocked out from political discourse and this is the best ways in which they are able to engage with policy that directly and mostly affects them.",constructive1,junkim42,round3,76.0,2
119,119,378,"The only way that you can understand that yes, this is effecting a large number of people is you actually care about those people to begin with, and we think the only way you get that is when political leaders are able to not only include the statistics and the magnitude of the numbers, but also say, ""Hey, out of these large number of people I'm talking about, this is a story of a woman that's actually experiencing this poverty in this county. This is why this economic policy needs to be put in place."" That is the lead up to actually be able to interpret and actually quantify and understand and value the numbers that a lot of these political leaders need to use. Because if I don't care about X group of people, then the number that you could give me all the statistics in the world and it's not going to be as important to me. I have to actually understand as a voter or fan base why those numbers should even matter to me, and it's very hard because we can't just debate in the realm that, ""I'm going to care about all these numbers."" Because a lot of people in, especially in the United States, when we look at the conservative groups of people, don't care about a lot of these issues that they're not pertaining to themselves, which means the numbers are irrelevant to them. In order for them to actually understand that there's things we need to care about outside of their scope is you have to make them more empathetic and compassionate to other groups of people. Meaning you have to make sure they understand why this is important, that we're talking about it on a debate scale in the first place.",constructive1,mnjanse,round3,76.0,2
120,120,379,"The second thing is that objectivity cannot cover all these bases, right? Ameesh gives you a lot of good points. Like when you talk about the vulnerability of groups of people, the dignity of other groups of people. We're talking about like a lot of the things that come on debate are like healthcare policies or economic, foreign immigration and things that. I think that's really important to a lot of people that exist in countries today. And if they don't understand the magnitude of that, and the fact that like a lot of people's dignities are just being ripped apart because the policies that we're putting in place. We have to care about that, right? And we can't possibly make that a thing in objectivity strictly. We cannot put numbers into dignity and how this makes certain groups of people vulnerable in society. There's just no comparison and no way to do that. If you want people to understand that people are losing their dignity, people feel vulnerable in our society and we need to help them. The only way you get that as you start to increase the compassion that exists in our country, and you have to have political leaders actually experience like, ""Hey, we have to talk about this one children,"" or whatever, so that they understand that this is impacting with the younger generation like gun control and gun violence. Right? It wasn't just enough that we talked about the numbers of how many times mass shootings happen every day. It's when we see children going up and telling their political leaders to talk about this was the thing, share the experience of Parkland and Sandy Hook and things like that, so that we understand that this is affecting large masses of people and we need to care about, right?

121,121,389,"So first of all, I want to talk about... is the reality is that politics is in by nature, it is subjective. We do not all want the same thing. We have different ideas of what we want and we have different ideas of how we're going to get there. So this is not something that's objected. This is in its nature a subjective field. So by ignoring the fact that politics... what we see right now or in the situation where there is no subjective experiences brought into the thing where we only have hard facts, you're ignoring the fact of why people want what they want, which is extremely important in political discourse. We can't just be talking hard numbers all the time. We have to have a reason behind these numbers. The reality is that these numbers have stories and when you hear them you kind of have to fill in the gaps and you have nothing to fill in the gaps with. Subjective experiences allow us to get the full picture of what's really going on. So what happens in a world where we do allow subjective experiences into political discourse? So people are going to be able to understand the underlying principles behind which people base their opinions, which is very important. Not only in expressing your opinion but kind of making sure... I think right now we're in a country and now it's very politically divided. What happens is that people are not listening to why people want things. Which is a lot more impact... like saying it, ""I want universal health care, I want blah blah blah."" We have to talk about why we want that. Otherwise, it's completely irrelevant because it kind of just looks like throwing out facts which is exactly what you're doing. You need to give a reasoning behind your opinions and often that's not going to be factually based. It's going to be based on a different lived experiences of every single person. Everyone's going to have a different experience whether it's socioeconomically, racially, everyone going to have a different perspective to bring in. By not listening to those facts, we actually limit political discourse because now people are not able to talk about the root cause of the problems, which is actually what we need to address by just talking about facts.

My partner started to go into this with talk about some famous anarchists, such as Emma Goldman, who said that private property is inherently wrong because the moment you are born, you are born into a world that is owned by others. This is inherent evil because it leads to more oppression. However, many anarchists say that we can not have anarchy unless we decentralize the economy and stuff like that. We think that that is not feasible until the best possible option is this policy that would punitively tax home ownership which would disincentivize private property ownership. We think this is a net good, we believe that on our side of the house, we are transitioning away from the corrupt notion of private property by making it so that the majority of people do not partake in owning private property.",constructive1,pbissail,round1,76.0,2

I want to talk to you about the stake owners, such as people of color in the United States. One of the main ways in which we got a boost of private property was after World War II with the G.I. Bill, that is how many people and many families came to own a home today. and maintained generational wealth. Who got left out of the G.I. Bill? African American soldiers who went and fought in World War II got less benefits from this bill. This means that they had been behind in the home ownership game from the beginning.

While those have been overturned, we believe that the effects are still inherent today, and we believe that people should not take part in this oppressive system. Private property and housing was designed to be exclusive, to be oppressive and to be unjust. While, these are examples are from the United States, we know that this is not just a U.S. centric problem. We believe that people of color and people in minority groups have been left out of the private property game. We would rather have that the majority of people not buy into this system. We believe that's a net good because we believe that people should protest unjust laws and should actively try to not participate in them.

We believe that is a net harm because, it leads to a lot of goods produced, a lot of goods thrown away and a lot of goods made for quick use and then thrown away. We believe that once you have people see that private property in the form of home ownership is bad.

We believe that just like owning a lot of houses will no longer be a sign of status, people will start to shift away from thinking owning a lot of clothes as a sign of status, owning a lot of cars is a sign of status. We believe that when you see that homes are the most visible part of private property and you start to change the thinking of the public around that, you'll see the change in people's mindsets in other things.

And it means that the countries that they are citizens of, that they economically contribute to, that they're a part of a social community for are actively discriminating against them and preventing them from all of these positive impacts that I told you about about why religion is important.

154,154,684,"Firstly, I want to analyze for you why the federal government is the best actor in this scenario. Why do we think that principally they're the best actor?

Within the nation, we see that there's going to be more citizen buy-in within this society because they feel more satisfied. They're not being discriminated against. The government is standing up for them. But secondly, on an external level on the international scale, we think it sends a signaling effect. There's a need for us to have an increased importance as leaders of the global liberal order when you look specifically at the US or Canada.

For example, the Quran makes accommodations for women who just cannot work jobs. Like for things like if they can't work with it, that is specifically in the Quran. If you cannot work with a hijab, then you do not have to wear the hijab. That means that religions make allowances for these things so it is not a complete violation of your religion because there are accommodations that can be made. And finally, remember that they punish the victims as well by making the burden fall on them when federal funding is taken away. We think that courts are always going to be better mechanism.",constructive1,mstonem,round5,76.0,2

We say that that's far more important. They also don't answer the fact that it can just be overturned later depending on the government. If you believe that there is any justification for why this or why any of these laws might not be a violation of religious freedom, you believe that there will be no precedent to keep these laws enshrined. And therefore you can go back and forth with each administration not having a solid law.",constructive2,mstonem,round5,76.0,2
158,158,699,"Next we think that the courts are better because there's going to be violation of basic democratic rights when you take a specific policy for states and you have the federal government decide. If they say the federal government is elected so therefore it's better, but state and provincial governments are elected too, they're just more directly elected. You have a smaller body of people, so therefore your vote has more impact. We say the people of Quebec know far better what is important for Quebec than these federal bodies because they are far more distant. They have the cultural differences, and it's just a huge group of people you are counting for the interests of a much smaller group of people. We say that the federal government does not have the right to decide of the interests of Quebec specifically.

Whether or not these are being validated in the state it's going, we feel they have a right to have a platform to get these across. Right? And Maya talked to you about, why specifically having this kind of platform is so important. Right? Because you have these integration of these ideas into public debate, which means a larger number of people are actually being able to access them. It's not a racist going on a rant somewhere, but it's somebody being able to actually counter what that racist is saying on national television as a result to which he's probably able to change these millions of people.",constructive1,amaanianam,round3,76.0,2
160,160,710,"Secondly, I will talk to you about research, right? About how probably you don't need this kind of research because I'm likely to be able be persuasive to people who have any experience. We're not really talking to you about having extreme research in these areas. We are going to argue for about the fact that you're supposed to have different kinds of research. Right? We're talking to you about the fact that the kind of things these minorities experienced aren't things that can be statistically reported for a variety of reasons that Maya pointed out that we're really able to understand. Because of the fact that researchers more often than not don't really have an incentive into researching these things or that these people don't feel comfortable wasting all these things. As a result of which we don't really have enough statistics. We feel we want these emotional experiences, replacing that kind of subjective research that exists in large quantities for white people, researching white people, we want these minorities to be able to voice their emotional experiences, and that kind of research to be able to enter the political sphere so that you have better policy making. Something else we've talked about, right? And here's what we feel like they completely feelknowledge, right? Our entire idea about how this lead to long term and better policy making. It's about the fact that because these ideas are in your political sphere, the politician that are probably being elected are not only potentially being elected because they specifically care about these issues and constituents vote for them, on the basis of this, as a result of which there's better policy making. Because they themselves are more aware of these issues and are able to legislate better on them. I.e. A woman who has maybe had an abortion and is able to personally relate to that and better legislate on it. But on a second level, there's probably likely to be more knowledge of these issues. So even if that political representative doesn't come into government, we have at least have enough knowledge probably care more about that issue. Or people talk more about that issue as a result of which they have an incentive to better lay on the basis of that issue. Right?",constructive2,amaanianam,round3,76.0,2
161,161,711,"So firstly, on our model, you're probably going to have more policy makers who can actually be made to the lived experiences of minorities because we've been able to integrate these narratives into the political spectrum. As a result of which, you have more people wanting for these contestants on the basis of that. But on a second level, because you generally have more knowledge and more awareness of these issues that you weren't able to access through statistical evidence because those statistics don't exist, now all because we have these discourses entering your political spectrum, you have normally more of a framework to build upon these issues and legislate get on them. But you have more of an incentive to build upon these issues and legislate about them because you know their constituents hear about them because people have been talking about them. They're integrated into bids and through a big deal. And frankly, if get elected and you don't do anything about it, you're a dick. Right? But let's talk to you about what Maya stand by. She talking about how this is uniquely very, very important because these issues are not only going to entry public sphere, as a result of which better legislation. Which are actually going to have more action, more social groups and action groups actually these issues. Right. We see this already happening with things like big tobacco or things the people are talking about or things that matter in your political spectrum. Right? You feel you're going to have a larger number of, for instance, why women becoming aware of these issues versus why women channeling and funding more charities for women who've been sexually abused and in certain neighborhoods. Which they wouldn't otherwise even having knowledge of because of the fact that they live in a bubble that is not infiltrated by these discourses to begin with. We feel like this funding will normally create more awareness for these specific groups in your study, but it's also going to lead more people talking about them as a whole. Which in the long run is going to lead to these issues becoming more and more important. You already see this happening. Right? For instance, like women coming up and talking about how they are sexual assault survivors. We feel that if these narratives had been normalized where you're on through channels such as public debate and political discourse, we feel it you'd be at a stage where people could be talking about more of these things more so and more earlier on.",constructive3,amaanianam,round3,76.0,2
162,162,712,"Firstly, the efficacy of political debate. The context here is very simple: Emotions and subjective experiences in political debate are seen as an unfair magnifier or serve as an unfair magnifier of the perceived harm of political policies. Why? Firstly, personal examples or personal experiences have, by definition, a sample size of one: I experienced this. But what it implies is that that experience is generalized to the entire public. But second, the centrality of these emotions in a political debate stay more shockingly and remain in the people's mind. I think this places the unfair magnifier of these harms of these political policies
What are the harms? Threefold. Firstly, we think that this makes a loud minority deceive the majority into voting against their own interest. What government side has to support, in this case, is Trump and his fear-mongering strategy to get the majority of the population to vote against their own interest. It's things like emotionalized experiences of crime and violence that take the status of Mexican immigrants out of context and say, ""This is what they are doing."" And when people talk about personal experiences of having a crime done to them by a Mexican immigrant, that does not mean that that is a generalized truth in America in today's world, right? But it emotionally moves certain people who directly perceive this as a generalized situation. We think that this deceives the majority into voting for policies that are not right for them. Notice the bias here. Positive emotions are far less effective in the political sphere than negative emotions. At the point in which personal experiences directly focus on negative aspects of certain immigrant populations or certain minorities, we think that this disproportionately harms them, to the exclusion of others. We think that it's very hard to compare different personal experiences. That's why voters can't make an objective account in this case. The second harm that comes from personal experiences in political debate is that this pushes politicians to the extremes. That's to say when emotions and personal experiences dominate political debate, every politician is forced to engage in that. Why? Firstly, just a large perception that this is somehow more powerful and persuasive to the public. But second, they want to avoid sounding really cold and calculating, at the point to which other politicians are talking about very personal stories, where you're talking about numbers. Why is it incredibly bad? Firstly, you lose the opportunity to genuinely inform the politics and what policies each candidate stands for. Notice that publicized and televised political debates or other unique opportunities to actually inform the public on political issues and get them to be informed voters when they actually do elections. You lose this opportunity at the point in which you focus more on personal accounts and subjectivity, rather than actual facts and what policies each candidate stands for.",constructive1,andrewyun7,round3,76.0,2
163,163,713,"But secondly, some policies get talked about disproportionately more at the point in which personal experiences are a bigger part of those specific policies, like immigration or healthcare policies. Whereas you don't talk about other experiences that are removed from personal experiences, like foreign policy issues, because you're not likely to, as a person, resonate with those policies as a whole. Therefore, you get a disproportionate sway to one side of policies that get talked about.",constructive2,andrewyun7,round3,76.0,2
164,164,714,"The last thing I want to say under this argument is that politicians are less likely to translate their promises into policy at the point in which political debate focuses more on personal accounts. Why is this so? Firstly, you focus more on the problem, rather than actionable solutions, at the point in which personal experiences largely serve to identify what the problem is in society. But secondly, you get less tied down by campaign promises, at the point in which publicized debates are focused less on making campaign promises and promising to the public, rather than just focusing on personal accounts and subjective issues that serve to try to move the public emotionally. Secondly, I'm going to talk about how this harms social groups that are involved. Firstly, I think you prompt the opposition parties to attack your experiences directly, rather than the policies that you stand for. There is a difference between attacking objective political preferences that you have and attacking painful experiences that are very integral to who you are. If you're a woman in the workforce who suffered from workplace discrimination or an immigrant who is refused service because of your race and your opposition party in these political debates say that your experiences are illegitimate or not what is largely true about the world, we think that that harms you personally. But secondly, an impact of that is you socially divide the populace even more, at the point in which the experiences that you as a member of a particular social group are more likely to have become politicized in and of themselves. Your party allegiance is directly tied to who you are and your identity, and that's more likely to segregate the voting population into different social groups who think that's terrible for the political atmosphere in the long term.",constructive3,andrewyun7,round3,76.0,2
165,165,726,"So now let's go to why the ideal political debate happens on our side. Why do emotional appeals obfuscate the responsibility of the political system and what is politically right? Why? Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.",constructive1,djasson,round3,76.0,2
166,166,727,"Furthermore, we talked about the political debate. Needing to produce the best result, you need to pull together the most local information and how a reasoning that can be weighed and your emotional bandwidth is limited. So therefore, even if you can empathize with everyone, you can't keep up and emotional aspects of debate wear off far quicker than logical reasoning. We think fragmentation of experience means that emotions go both ways. That means again, if you feel very strongly about marginalized people in your country emotionally, well someone can feel the exact same way and the other way and it's a wash. We think that fragmentation of experience is also why there's not enough action on issues like gun control or climate change because everyone has only small experiences that don't pull together to the big picture, that only data and reasoning can explain.",constructive2,djasson,round3,76.0,2
167,167,735,"Note secondly that there is no such thing as objective policy. That policy is fundamentally around trade offs. Now when you engage in certain actions such as, tariffs, that benefits certain populations and harms others. Subsidies, benefit certain populations and harms others. We'll give you an example, but very specifically that Reagan, for example, didn't fund AIDS treatment because his objective analysis told him that prioritizing the funding on the War on Drugs was a problem affecting significantly more Americans and thus it's not worth it to try to benefit a small subset of gay people because the war on drugs was a bigger problem. That's what his objective analysis told him. Okay, so note that there's no such thing as objective policy. You need to recognize that all policy is about making trade offs on who to benefit, who to harm, and that needs to be something that's contextualized based on lived experiences.",constructive2,samuelwu,round3,76.0,2
168,168,743,"Again by essentially laying down the burden of this debate, right? The burden of this debate is to prove which alternative leads to better policy and which alternative leads to better representation. [SAI 00:00:11] government necessarily believes that a narrative that is rejected, the exclusion of objectivity, the exclusion of active politics, the exclusion of personal experiences, the exclusion of policy, the exclusion of passion, and the exclusion of relatability definitely leads to worse politics. Does not lead to better policy and does not lead to better representation. Not all of our contentions and all of our wants to exist. I think some amount of characterization is necessary, right? So how does politics work in status quo? Politics right now works essentially in two exchange, right? We have right wing, or fanatic, politics that essentially relates to individuals by being a lot more persuasive, by being a lot more passionate, by being a lot more engaging. By being sometimes louder, by using more relatable content. We believe that in status quo politics, we believe that because of this division between passive politics and passionate politics and active politics, we do believe that a lot of the times better policies in terms of the people that believe that politics should be ideally objective loses out because right wing politics are more fanatic and passionate politics wins out, only because of the fact that they seem to be motivated, right? In status quo, we believe that people that are just being a lot more passionate, but don't have better policies, win out only because of the terms of relatability, as opposed to people that are pursuing more idealistic, considerably non-manipulative politics lose out even though they do have better policies and even a better represent quality, right? We believe that being relatable is definitely something that comes from being a lot more active, a lot more persuasive, relating to your personal experiences, and being a lot more subjective, right? In current age's cool politics, we think that policy's losing out because individuals who believe in better policy are pursuing more objective politics, right? Now we're questioning the actual objectivity of politics in Do we think that the status quo of politics, even though excludes personal experiences and subjectivity and passionate content and rhetoric, do we actually believe that this is objective politics, right? SAI government believes that law is not really objective in terms of the fact that in presumably objective politics we believe that minorities and women, that essentially derive a lot of their passion and inspiration from their own personal experiences, as well as a motivator to change status quo experience of that kind of influence that'll suppress them, and utterly being hard because of the fact that objective has essentially skewed the words individuals that don't act from an aspiration or inspiration political, right? We believe that minorities and women always want to talk about things that have affected them and always want to talk about how they want to change things for the millions that face this exact same predicament, are being left out in objective, presumably objective, politics, only because every single time they ascribe to any of the personal experiences that have led them to stand for office, that have led them to relate to people who are facing the same experiences, are rejected in status quo politics by virtue of being overly passionate, overly emotional, right?

169,169,744,"Firstly, we believe that it's going to be inclusive by not only being to intellectuals. We necessarily believe that in the presumably objective politics that this isn't status quo, would be the right wing caters to the majority and left wing are more national and less persuasive. Presumably persuasive politics only caters to the intellectuals because we think that ideal politics are the most of dealing with politics is talking about logic and talking about facts and we do believe that there is a lot of value in these, but we believe that the relatability and presentation and value that most people expect politics to is lost by virtue of the fact that most of the majority is not really engaged with just facts and logic. It kind of washes over their heads and therefore, they're not really voting for right wing because they believe they are better politics, but just because they felt is was a lawful policy that was set. We believe that idealistic politics loses out on the presentation and value and presentation and value is what causes that line of engagement and transaction between representation and quality which is lost out on this objective narrative of what politics really is, right? We feel it's going to be a lot more inclusive in terms of talking to the majority, in terms of what we actually relate to and talk to the majority in something that we find persuasive. That way we engage them to actually listen to you and then in turn, listen to what policy you're really talking about, rather than just doing numbers and statics that someone who's gone to higher grad school is eager to without really motivating or provoking their attention, right? We believe this provocation of attention exists a lot more in a land where you're persuasive and active and relating your personal experiences, right? This is not to say that passionate politics is aggressive or violent politics. Through this characterization and there is SAI government is not really advocating for vengeful politics whatsoever We're just talking about a line where a lot more engaging and persuasive, as opposed to being docile and completely expressionless, right?",constructive2,ppk261,round3,76.0,2

We believe this is not going to exist in a paltry, objective narrative. In terms of in existing narratives, Grasso's campaign is basically impossible of right?
You wouldn't see in objective narratives anyone like AOC actually rising up from Grasso's campaigning because an entire campaign the fact that Latino-Americans face these kind of experiences and that relates to the immigrant population which is a vast majority of Americans and ""I feel you, so you'll listen to me, right?""

171,171,787,"Our first independent argument is about the longterm success of children. We argue that early childhood care creates a positive feedback loop because children who have early childhood care, have the greatest ability to engage in... Have the greatest ability to learn material later down the line because of increased care and attention that they're given as children. We think that these strong resources that they've been given early and they're carried through to later parts of your life, which results in increased preparation for college and increased success when they're in college. A couple subpoints to this argument. So first... So our Subpoint A is that we can add readiness, we can have readiness after early childhood care is incredibly important, not just when students enter college, but also leading up to college. So throughout the entire primary and secondary education system, we also think that the educational benefits that they gained in early childhood education accrued through those years as well. So we think that early childhood education affects all 12 plus years of education. Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student. Which means that aren't super expensive per student compared the price of early childhood education.

This means that we have to increase the ability of students, especially low income students or students of color to access early childhood education because doing so would do more to resolve these educational inequities. We think this  answers any arguments raised by the off teams about inequities that arise later in college because inequities going into college are largely created by inequities that started in early childhood education. We also think that as early childhood education always includes like medical care. We think that medical attention or medical support for families can also help resolve psychological issues that can make it harder for students to succeed in school.",constructive2,meganwu,round2,76.0,2
173,173,790,"Our third independent argument is that early childhood education is super important for parents. We can have parents because ECC includes support for parents, we think that the need for this that falls in parents is greater than the need for funding for students because college students a higher ability to take care of themselves. For example, they are hopefully self-sufficient adults, maybe not, I don't know, but hopefully college students are more self-sufficient than a toddler who requires attention at all times. Moreover, the parents who call hopefully don't have to do that much to support their students, but the parents of toddlers or young infants have a ton of burdens to fall on them. For example, they have to have the burden of starting a career, raising a child, and possibly taking care of their own parents and that ways, which means that support for a parents accrues exponentially in the longterm as well. And for example, if the parent of a young child has more support going into early childhood care and that allows them to be a better chance to start their own career running.

I think we need to recognize that that's something... The stability that that offers, and I am with my partner's points about how it also makes it easier just to have a community of people where you know your neighbors, where you can go out and practice, go to your local churches and establish local institutions. Not only does that make life cheaper and easier, but it also makes life more stable for youth growing up in this community. On the comparative, I think that's uniquely valuable and I think uniquely, like keep that under our side of the house, when we make it just cheaper and easier to be a marginalized person and a poor person in these communities.",constructive1,vkamr052,round1,79.0,4
184,184,105,"On to the point of local politics. And I think this is something where, O.G didn't really talk a lot on. When we talk about these areas, we're not just talking about stability. We're also talking about political stability. As someone who's renting a house, I think that renting a house just because of the point that... Especially in this class is very well the government's point on the idea that like as a renter, you're constantly in the state of a housing mobility. You're constantly trying to move around, evaluate your opportunities for what the cheapest possible alternative to where you're living is. I think having this process is even worse when you have predatorial rental practices on the part of large corporations. So I don't think you necessarily get to invest in your community, politically speaking, the way you would under a situation where you can actually own a house. I think this is especially true in areas where local politics is super important. Where you vote on air, where you vote on your judges and you vote on attorneys.

In high school, you don't learn to be an engineer, you don't learn to be an accountant, you don't learn to provide the kinds of services that companies rely on. So you need to actually go to get... You need to go to a vocational school or you need to go to college. You need to go to some kind of institution, which prepares you for this kind of work so that you can actually help develop the economy. What does this look like? So in places like Zimbabwe or Peru or China, it means that you need electricians to go and electrify the rural countryside, to build roads to villages that were otherwise inaccessible and literally do not have access to any kind of education so far to begin with.",constructive1,amspector100,round2,79.0,4

These are the core of the economy because people can't work, for example, if they're sick and there's no doctor to treat them or treatment is prohibitively expensive. So we think that if you have these kinds of mid-skilled workers, you are likely to an incredible amount of economic growth. It's the infrastructure by which the economy runs and ultimately, when these jobs come in, right, it's going to help everyone. If Google comes in and hires a bunch of electricians to build access to internet for people, they're going to need menial workers who don't have any education.

The company sees a market opportunity and they go and you see economic development. Why does this matter more than any of the other arguments we've made? First, we think this matters more than OGs arguments about inclusivity in the labor force because if there aren't enough jobs to begin with, then guess who's going to get...

Like the white male philosophers who came up with reason, and it was this divine spark that made us human, and how that's left out other people who weren't a part of that process and continues to cause white male voices to dominate in our society. We think their points were a perfect illustration of that. The problem is that narratives of objectivity are abused to penalize marginalized people: specifically, as my partner tells you, looking at women and POC, which we think are good illustrations of this concept about women being overly emotional, and are therefore deemed unfit for office. That their arguments are illegitimate, whether that's online, or in a news station, or in political debates. We think the stereotype of women being more emotional can cause us to perceive them as overly dramatic, sentimental, unstable, because it's not the ideal. Because we view it as a problem, and we think we see this with Warren and Kamala, who focus a lot on personal appeals and stories and are often dismissed for that reason: because they're not rational. Especially with someone like Elizabeth Warren, that she's just a populist trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that she's too emotional to be in this race. We think that racial minorities are more often sidelined from being viewed as angry and irrational. We think particularly people in the black community often have their arguments dismissed, because they're perceived as too angry. We think we saw this with the discourse around Black Lives Matter, which for the most part was not violent and when they ... But the whole movement was very quickly characterized as violent, because we think we're ready to penalize emotion as being something bad, and because of this narrative that says that that should not exist in our political discourse. We also think it's a white male construct, because people who have more to lose are always going to be more emotional. It is the luxury of the privileged to be able to talk about issues that don't personally affect them in a flat tone, in a neutral way, and be like, ""Oh, I can see both sides of it."" When your life is on the line, you can't see both sides. When your access to an abortion puts your autonomy at risk, you're going to be more angry about it. And so, we think what we do when we put emphasis on objectivity is we raise the voices of the privileged who can afford to be neutral, and we minimize the people whose real experiences are too intense, too painful, to just have this flat affect and not express their own subjective experiences when they talk about these issues.

Academia is not objective but is substantially more objective than subjective claims that exist in the policy in general. This is why things like for instance, Kimberly Crenshaw's claim intersectionality is not that 'I subjectively feel this to be true' but rather that there are indeed in the legal regime, existing pathways for instance where black people cannot get as great and cannot get as good but the unique social situation of black woman is not protected as a class- that is the inside of intersectionality, and that is the material fact that is not a subjective claim.
The same thing for instance with Richard Wallenstein demonstrated how the federal government segregated United States. It is not a subjective claim. It is a fact and that is how you get more policy that is better on our side of the house. Another example of this for instance is disrupting rectified power structures. For instance, where you understand federal colonialism as a fixture, as a structure rather than as an event that happened. We only get that by excavating the histories and relying on objective facts. So, on our side of the house, what we want to emphasize is that there is no way to communicate between subjective claims on their side of the house. Using academia as a hero stick, we think we get substantially better discourse that is more the wants and leads to the policies that actually solves the problem as it goes into banning solutions.",constructive1,kflynndo,round3,79.0,4
211,211,393,"Secondly, we see that when you privilege objectivity and create this narrative where objectivity is equivalent to intelligence, if you feel that you cannot play in the field of objectivity, you feel you cannot engage on a level of high intelligence. We think this is specifically harmful for people who have less access to education and whose experiences ... who have subjective experiences, which are so powerful that motivates them to engage in politics. But when you have that subjectivity, you want to engage more and you are able to do so because under our side of the house, you erase this narrative. You lead to greater engagement from those groups because they don't feel like they have to be told that they're not smart. They feel that they will be heard and as a result they are more likely to engage, we uniquely tell you not only why that narrative is harmful, we tell you why. Under a counterfactual you get much bigger engagement because people can also see that they can win those confrontational debates. They won't be seen to be unintelligent and they will no longer have their access to education be a detriment to them.",constructive2,jamesashwell,round2,79.0,4
212,212,456,"We would also say when you do buy property, you buy a property in places that are rentable, where you have an interest in renting. So you're much more likely to buy property in urban areas where you can get away with renting to people. If I buy something in rural Geneva, might be, or like Ithaca, New York, let's say where I'm from, it's much harder to rent houses to people, well actually the poor tabloid. If you live in the middle of nowhere, trying to rent private properties to people, so you're less likely to buy them because of the previous contenders.",constructive1,jacobsilcoff,round1,79.0,4
213,213,458,"We also say that the risk in terms of investing in a place is lower when you're doing a place that is higher density because any smaller town, small influxes and someone leaving, makes it much harder to fill that spot. Whereas in an urban area with millions of people, it's easy to replace someone if they move out. So it's a lot less risky for you as an investor. Why is this density necessarily a good thing? Three reasons, firstly, we said it's good for the environment because utilities are substantially less needed. You pay for heating to heat a space. So if more people in the same space and per person, less utility. We will say you're less needing to drive places, which means your environmental cost there goes down.",constructive2,jacobsilcoff,round1,79.0,4
214,214,459,"You can distribute services more efficiently. When you bring a bunch of food into a city, it can be distributed to millions of people as opposed to going to tons of different directions on trucks, much lower environmental costs. Generally, cities are way better for the environment. We say on that basis alone, it's worth creating this incentive to help the environment. We say that there are societal benefits because when you're renting to people and you're literally your own house, you're a lot more likely to be mixed with different social classes. When you're riding public transit, you might be likely to see people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. You care about their issues because they're literally your neighbors and to reduce instrumentation on the basis of rich people that own their houses are now more likely to rent them to people that are probably poor off. We say that that's probably good for the social interests with people that are voting in these elections. We think that's a good reason to incentivize the shift in renting.",constructive2,jacobsilcoff,round1,79.0,4
215,215,460,"We would also say just on the individual level, as I was saying, it's much easier to do things like move to a new place if you need. When you invest in a house, you can't just move if you need to get a new job somewhere else without going through the hassle of selling your house, especially if you have a mortgage, it can be incredibly difficult to do. So it sort of ties people down to a specific spot. We've seen, I think, it's actually for someone that has an unstable job situation, it's much easier because you can get up and move if you need to, you're not tied down to a specific place. If you have a lower income and then get a higher one, it's easier for you to move into a better place. But just say renting is a really good stable thing for you.",constructive2,jacobsilcoff,round1,79.0,4
216,216,473,"And we think that often, housing is the main way that they can accumulate wealth, that is to say the mechanism for social mobility for the middle class is often through owning a house, seeing its property value go up over time and using that to, for example, take out a loan to start a business or send your kids to college.",constructive1,amspector100,round1,79.0,4
217,217,474,"So second and most importantly, we think only the rich have the sophistication and time to evade these kinds of laws. I'll talk about that a little more in the future, but it means that ultimately the tax is likely, the brunt of the tax, is most likely to fall on the middle class. So with that said, I'm going to give two today.",constructive2,amspector100,round1,79.0,4
218,218,475,"So with that said, I'm going to give two today. First thing that happens is it reduces social mobility for the middle class, why this is particularly important.

219,219,477,"but the last impact here is actually particularly important, which is that we think this prevents political capture across the entire country. Even if they say that the most important individuals are the individuals who can't afford houses in the status quo who are going to get access to the forms of social housing, we think that you help them the most on our side of the house because when you need in a functioning democracy is a large of wealth, a large shareholder in the nation, which is able to combat the political influence of the wealthy.

220,220,521,"We think that in cities like New York City, San Francisco with the choice of how or why we have levels of gentrification that have made it really hard to buy rent. There's excess of demand and not enough supply. We think this has to many effects, right? It's the costs are too high and a lot of these renting areas and not at the time and like we have insufficient supply and people are left out and don't get housing. We think that naturally if you reduce housing purchases for these people in that liminal area between the working class and the middle class, that means that they're forced to like be subjected to renting, right? Which already is subject to huge problems. We think that then, what you're just doing is increasing the demand for rent that is already too high, which is going to raise prices further, which is going to mean that their further locked out of the supply to do what we have is actually less people in poverty who are able to have access to this housing.",constructive1,nmcdowe,round1,79.0,4

We also think that like the mechanisms to control rent are really poor right now. Like rent control, which is the most common solution to this problem actually makes it worse, right? Because when you have rent control, that means that it's not as lucrative to enter the industry. Right? So if you're artificially setting the price to low then that means that more renters are not going to enter the market, which means that even if you're solving the price problem, you're hurting the supply problem.",constructive1,nmcdowe,round1,79.0,4
222,222,633,"Okay, moving on. So first of the importance of religious freedoms. First of all, I think Jacob makes it very clear there's no real gravitation to the fact, but oftentimes it's important to allow marginalized people and religious minorities to have certain freedoms to allow then access the public good that we're talking about in this debate. Recognize that the point in which opening access, they're liable to be hurt by a lack of funding. That implies they're able to use that funding. ",constructive1,ruthsilcoff,round5,79.0,4
223,223,634,"This is not a debate on whether or not, you as a religious minority will be hurt, it's whether or not other people will be hurt because under this there are no repercussions for moderate voters who don't really care that much about social policy, but care about... Who care about adding on a policy. We say we change that because now we have moderate voters who actively care about putting in place policies the better policies for those with religious freedoms. We turn non-active, non-vocal moderates into active people who are now wanting to attend protests, who are now going out to vote because they care about these issues, because this policy has an effect on those moderates. We also say just for xenophobic people and people who are anti different religious communities, we think now they are directly tied on into this policy. This has to do with the argument that they gave us on backlash and people becoming more hateful.",constructive2,ruthsilcoff,round5,79.0,4
224,224,635,"So what I think the response is this, first I'd say that you might... Okay, so you might increase... The first thing I want to say is just that, I think hate groups oftentimes don't think they have a lot of support, and they're not supported sometimes. A lot of these politicians who want to pass these policies is because they're very radicalized, very vocal. They're not actually very large, though. They don't have a large number of supporters compared to moderates who hold the majority of the voter bases. They're not large in compared to the middle class who cares a lot about public systems being funded. They're not large in comparison to any of that.",constructive3,ruthsilcoff,round5,79.0,4
225,225,692,"And given the fact that there's already incentives to protect the majority, there's no reason why, or there's very little reason why States would want to pass this policy in favor of something that was limiting other people's rights, say a policy that was helping Christians or any other minority be Islamophobic or I'm sorry, be homophobic or something like that. Things that limit the rights of minorities are unlikely to be passed under this policy. So then, let's do this wing on this because O tells us that one case of funding loss in a state is enough to win this round. We tell you that's not the case. You may, even one case of fighting loss against one case of infringement on religious Liberty. Why did we win out? So first of all, L tell you about positive faith and the fact that for these people, they genuinely believe the way that they construct their worldview and have often constructed from birth is one that says your fate and forever ever more.",constructive1,miclew,round5,79.0,4

And it's extremely important in their existence. So I think that that impact on the people who are infringed on their liberty is far more massive in size. Right? Even if there are less of these people. But I would also contend that there are lots of these people and then these people are already marginalized in States. So it's important that we protect them in other ways. Right? Additionally, actually, sure. I'll take the fun half now.",constructive2,miclew,round5,79.0,4
227,227,701,"Secondly, to talk about this deal of the power imbalance, right? Because now that the federal government's exercising their power, there's going to be a power imbalance. One, you have to understand this already exists in the status quo. That is the problem. That is what the federal government is there for. They're literally there to exercise their power if and when the states themselves take away the civil liberties of the constituents of the country as a whole. We tell you then that if the power imbalance of only accepts that it's already there, then already it's only exercised then, if that is a very tenuous relationship. It's very specific. Then it's not usually exercised in the status quo and only exercised in small instances. We tell you then, when on the whole of the game, they're only using it to limit their injunctions on the specific matter of religious expression, there's not going to be a lot of backlash on their side that they keep talking about, because it's less likely that they care enough about this, and they're less likely to disrupt this already good relationship they have with federal government.",constructive2,mshah4523,round5,79.0,4

All right, so first point here, we're going to talk about who, what does this` mean to the individuals who lost their rights? We're going to say this majority does not happen to Christians anyway. This is not the people that was targeted by Quebec in the motion. This is the people that are probably not going to be effected even if this law goes into place. So what does this mean for the specific minorities? We tell you that symbols mean more to these people than, mean more to the people who use them. It's about how they express who they are. It's about a part of their identity, right? When I wear these symbols, I'm representing a part of who I am, and I'm showcasing to the rest of the world.",constructive3,mshah4523,round5,79.0,4

They don't want to lose economic benefit. And two, this is three, this is not like Brexit where the EU is it's own country that has a state and a trade economic zone. This is a country, this is a state within a country that has ties to it. Just take a look at the constitution on that. Even then weigh it this way. What state would give up all this for the possible gain of just other people wearing yamakas? Again and again, the problem is it doesn't affect the majority so it doesn't matter. This is about the principle of the federal government actually helping them. CEO tries to tell a POI this would only help Texans cause only in the case of Christians.

230,230,728,"Second question I want to bring up in this debate is why you get voters to come out and bring social cohesion. Because objective politics simply does not bring you enough justification on things such as care and empathy. What does that look like? It looks like the fact that political discussion would not be surrounded by John who said to that white police saying that, ""I want the best for you. I love you. Can I give you a hug?"" Right? These are things that will be subjected under our side and let us have the ability to unite people because these are incidents that will get African Americans to come out here and vote. Note the system that African Americans and minorities believe in are already flawed. They believe governments alienate them. That is why without subjective accounts saying that the person besides you might be killed and therefore you should come out to vote, those individuals would never turn out to the voting poll, and that is a greatest atrocity to an entire democratic practices, because democracy is premised on the fact that individuals have equal say. The moment when I only care about philosophical or political goals of mainly the very highest class form of objectivity is a moment when these individuals will be put in trains and never have their say in a political system. The ways in which you should engage with them therefore, is to feed into the society saying that your friends or your family members might be killed by white police, and therefore you should come up here and vote. The reasoning why we go for it in opening government is through the fact that we prove to you why subjectivity and objectivity can go in hand, and individuals will have the right to judge it by more to propose",constructive1,wesleychiu,round3,79.0,4
231,231,731,"Firstly, on their side of the house and in the status quo, the expectation of common agreeable debate excludes people with traumatic experiences from politics and from discussing the issues that most affect them. Why do we say this is the case? Imagine two people who are in the same room when a difficult, painful political topic is brought up, like the separation of children at the Southern border of the United States or starvation in a any topic that you want essentially. Someone who comes from a privileged background who hasn't experienced those harms, who's removed from them, is able to think about those things in an abstract sense. When something is abstract and not personal to you, that allows you to have this politically acceptable, calm way of discussing it, that allows you to not bring emotions into the conversation. We say this is a privilege that not all people have access though. Consider someone who has experienced the separation of their child at the Southern border or someone who's experienced starvation as a child. Those people often are not going to be able to restrain their emotions because they have strong emotions. They have strong personal feelings about the topics at hand, right? They have strong personal traumas and experiences that often get repressed. Often conversations about those topics are somewhat triggering for them. Now we say, ""Certainly some of those people will be able to restrain their emotions,"" but it's not fair to expect and demand that people restrain the emotions which they justifiably have, in order to have the privilege of engaging in the political discourse when that should in fact be a right. It's not fair to expect people to repress deep personal and intimate traumas in order to talk to others about the things that caused that traumatization. We say the impact of this exclusion is that often people who are the most impacted by political debates and issues are excluded from their conversations. Look at the TV when they're discussing the separation, like I said, the Mexican border. How many mothers who have actually had their children separated from them do you see? Very few. Typically, the people you see are privileged people who were born in the United States, who are American citizens, never had to migrate in search of a better life, talking abstractly about things they don't really have a personal understanding of. The people who are excluded from the debate, the actual people suffering from separation at the border have two important characteristics. Firstly, they bring the most important unique perspectives to the debate. We say that they are the people who are able to share stories that aren't necessarily found by the media that aren't necessarily found by independent investigators. They are able to share personal experiences that no one else has access to. Secondly, we say they're the most important, motivated advocates in order to solve this problem. They're never going to give up to solve a problem that deeply personally affects them and their quality of life. Where someone for whom that problem is merely academic may be willing to just give that up. Thirdly, we say they are the most effective communicators to motivate public change on this issue. Why is that the case? Because we say that they are able to use their emotions, which are a universal language that all human beings share to share the depth of the severity of their experience with others. Even if you come from a wealthy background and you've never suffered from political oppression, you can still understand what it feels like to be bullied or to be ashamed of some aspects as well, and we think this gives people who come from privileged backgrounds a greater capacity for political action and ability to empathize with people who are truly suffering from political oppression. 
This makes it easier for people from these backgrounds where they are oppressed, where they do suffer, to get society as a whole to mobilize on their behalf instead of only trying to make change themselves as minorities that are already disempowered. These three characteristics, we think, make it absolutely essential that people who may not necessarily be able to stay calm in a debate be part of that debate. Expectations that exclude them from the debate have to be removed from society.",constructive1,rowanley,round3,79.0,4
232,232,732,"Now, secondly, we tell you that anger and all other emotions have vital functions in the public sphere as a motivator of action. Understand that political systems act on mandates from the public, the political system responds to demands on it that are made by the public. We say that without anger, it's far more difficult to get action on issues that matter to people and it is particularly more difficult to get urgent action.
We say firstly, that minority groups who face disproportionate disadvantages due to their smaller sizes and a greater political disempowerment and lower political influence, need the use of strong emotions to break through the barrier of apathy that many of the general public feel about things that don't impact them. They need to be able to share with people emotions that they can relate to in order to break down the sense that something is not a personal issue to someone. When you relate an issue to personal feelings that someone has, maybe about other things in their past, then you're able to make that issue somewhat personal to them. You can make the separation of children deeply personal to someone even who's just experienced the frustration and anxiety like losing their children in the mall for a few hours. Obviously it's not emotion to the same depth, it's not the same kind of pain, but they can at least relate to the fact that's a painful, difficult experience and they can see that had they been born in someone else's shoes, it could have been them. I encourage right?",constructive2,rowanley,round3,79.0,4
233,233,733,"We say also that anger communicates urgency. Many problems need urgent solutions. The alleviation of families and the separation of children is not something that can wait for the long process of structured, calm, sober debate to come to a logical consensus. These are issues where there is a clear moral right and wrong. When people can come up with logical arguments that would seem to make clearly unjustifiable and amoral things acceptable, right? You can twist it and use logic to come up with almost anything, but it's very difficult to emotionally justify why it is acceptable to separate children from their parents.
We stated the use of emotional motivators, of saying if something is deeply affecting you personally, it needs to change immediately, can break through gridlock that doesn't allow urgent action to be taken. We say this urgent action is absolutely necessary to make sure that real, immediate human suffering is resolved and more abstract issues like the financial problems of pension plans can maybe be dealt with in a calm way at a later date because they don't have the same kind of urgency associated with them.",constructive3,rowanley,round3,79.0,4
234,234,739,"Right. All of the things that they say. Give the wealthy nations within ACIAR power right now is used as leverage in order to help prop up these economies in those organizations. Right. I would say when they talk about, either that of China, that these organizations have absolutely no incentive to actually heal those economies in the long run because all they want is their debt paid back or strategic interests like I.e. China where they're trying to get secure geopolitical interests in those areas. I think that when they say they offer two critiques or three impacts of talking about how it's going to hurt, the autonomy of these nations and controlling your monetary policy. I think first of all, that the comparative is likely going to be paying to things like Europe or the US Dollar. Why is that the case? It's because of the fact that these nations are offering security investment that they use as their way to talking about why these nations care about currency in the first place is so that they can guarantee that stability. Right. This is the reason why these nations, the comparative would be campaigning their patient's currency to the Euro or US Dollar in order to facilitate getting that investment in the first place but are also in the house are able to gain that stability or tying themselves to ACIAR nations instead. That's able to get a bunch of better stability because now you're at the hands of actors who have an interest in growing your economy and actually caring about the regional interests that you face but evidence say that you're less able to print more money to pay off debts. I think this is the exact kind of incompetent monetary policy that we're trying to prevent. The kind of things that cause hyper inflation because you have a lack of transfer of information for regimes who are corrupt, have debt dealings with us. State owned enterprises that they use to propagate corruption that you mitigate on our side. When you tie nations together trying to help those nations actually like financially and economically recover. Even if you have one nation that is propped within that are or many nations that are propped within that sphere. Everybody has a collective interest in wanting the nations to succeed economically so you have more information going around as to what is the best move monetarily in order to heal those nations. I think when they say that thirdly that they have different contexts in which they're going to evaluate whether inflation is good, do we want the interest rate higher or low? All these things just recognize in ACIAR what ties them together relatively is that they're exporting nations that they want by a common interest in trade. Are they more over? You would also say that each of these nations within ACIAR, when they're governed monetary policy want to account for those different, who's differences and how they affect the economies because of the tight incentive that they have now. I think when they say that Singapore is a bigger economy of the end of their case, talking about how they're going to have the most power recognize that's in the status quo within the framework of ACIAR but also they should have the ability to within ACIAR to descend and generally they need to reach a consensus but then secondarily even if they have more power comparatively they care more in our world because they're able to bail out those countries. There are three main points of it. The three main points that AMAR brings up that bring us massive impacts in the ground, before I get to that I'll take closing it. If, you have one.",constructive2,123dyly,round4,79.0,4
235,235,752,"A little bit of weighing we would say that anger forces governments to create institutions to manage that anger. This is what comes out at the end of speech where he says that if you have a credible threat of people being angry and resorting to extra judicial means because their needs are not being met, that forces political systems to create institutions like courts that manage those conflicts in the long run. This is the most important issue in the route insofar as institutions resolve conflicts in the long run. So maybe emotional policies, let's take them at their best and say some emotional policies are created in the short run, but actually worse, they over-respond to subjective experience. But this is fine because in pluralistic societies we have a mechanism to negotiate those conflicts systematically between groups. So policies in the long run become more responsive because they're actually negotiating these conflicts. If you don't have a credible threat of anger, then elites are never incentivized to respond to the anger that exists in the majority, so these sort of angry things become prevalent in populous backlashes or extrajudicial means because they don't have a legitimate way of voicing their anger in the political system.",constructive1,prestonj,round3,79.0,4
236,236,753,"But even if this doesn't happen, we are still coming out on top, two reasons. Number one is that policy is less-elite centric. This definition, it means that more people are helped because public funds are sent to the public majority's as opposed to things like tax cuts because that's what elites think the facts say, is that the fact that we're going to help rich people by having this tax cut and because they preferentially weight those facts because that's what they think of objectivity is, it's elite-centric, that they're going to participate in those tax cuts more. Note that this also deals with OO, who says that sometimes subjective policy is harmful. We would also say that we mitigated this with the dog whistle analysis with regards to the racism stuff, but elite-centric policies always means that you help fewer people If we help more people with majoritarian policies, then we're helping more people definitionally. Second is we're likely to create strong law that can be reformed, so even if you get some bad laws in the short term, we're likely to reform these things in the long run.",constructive2,prestonj,round3,79.0,4
237,237,756,"First, there's a point of distance, both physical and psychological. This is Will's response, so like the Yemen example, that is to say it's really hard for people to empathize with the Yemeni children who they've never met and are nothing like them. You're a lot more likely to empathize with people who remind you of yourself and your neighbors, people who are like you physically and psychologically. But I think Will also bring forth the physical example of who is coming forward. First, the onus is put on certain people to come forward that is, if it is the case, there are some people who are suffering so much that it is so hard for them to come forward and share their story and they probably won't come forward on either side of the house, but you just coerce them into doing it or you put an onus on them and they're unlikely to come forward. But also who gets access to the camera to be able to tell their story? Who is it that politicians are listening to? Who is it that's broadcast on the air? It is a media elite who can control these specific anecdotes that are put forth in the same way that tough on crime policies in DC in the 1960s, as Will explained, were propagated because anchors and network leaders were able to go to specific members of the black community who were the most privileged who said, ""Oh we want tough on crime policies,"" able to ignore the vast majority of people who didn't. Also. So what does this mean? I think we give you examples. It means you under weigh people who aren't like you that is foreign policy decisions get a lot worse because you're never going to be interviewing this Yemeni child. You just drop a drone strike because you can't fully empathize with the subjective experiences. But you can empathize with subjective experience that people who are like the subject of terror attacks at home, it means you under weigh victims. That is to say you never listen to victims of sexual assaults because you always think, ""Oh that can't happen to me."" Or ""Oh, it's her fault for dressing slutty."" And you're a lot more likely to empathize with your white side and who could be falsely accused of rape. Even if the statistics say that only 1.5% of rape allegations are false, you always are never emphasizing with victims because you can never see yourself as being one of those victims. But we also think that Will tells you that there's a gender or racialized conception of who has the ownership of certain emotions. That is to say if we always think of women as being able to be the victims, this could actually be a very bad thing. Meaning when white woman accused a black man of rape, they have the monopoly on the sympathy emotion of being able to appeal to that. But when a black man or a black family is a victim of police brutality, they can't access these emotional appeals in the same way. And when you increase the magnitude of that subjectivity in discourse, people will always listen to the white female victim or like the white police officer who they are a lot easier to empathize with when things like objectivity, how many people are actually the subject of police brutality or like the fastest particular case are glossed over by the media.",constructive1,srbaxi,round3,79.0,4

First, I don't think they necessarily give you warrants for why this is the case when Will provide you at least some tools, why it's easier to access objectivity than subjectivity if people are going to be dismissing our subjective experience out of hand. That is to say like when they bring up the case of Flint Michigan, the presence of led in the water is an objective fact and not a subjective experience that people can just dismiss. He brings up the thing about like critical studies departments, but I think a great example of this is Brown V Board. That is to say you didn't desegregate schools because people didn't care or listen to black children who felt bad about having to go to segregated schools. The way you got school desegregation was when critical race departments presented research in the Supreme Court where kids who went to segregated schools thought black dolls were literally worse or uglier than white dolls. You get this sort of research when you propagate objectivity that is segregated schools objectively change people's lives in a certain way and not rely on individual subjective anecdotes.",constructive2,srbaxi,round3,79.0,4

That is to say when there are studies that are bad because of the replicability crisis or when it is the case that people say, Ah, there's a big wealth disparity you get concerned politicians who say the wealth disparity is like a black person's fault either way, whether that's coming from subjective experience or objective. When you rely on objectivity, you at least make it a little bit easier for minorities to be able to say, ""Oh, but the magnitude is so great that we ought to do something about it.""

I think, if they can't afford to pay for daycare, there are two things that happens. I think first is that the kid lacks. This parent is probably not trained in childhood development. So, even if the parent is doing something like reading to the child, it's not going to be as good a development for the child as something like daycare at a school because they're specialist insurance at best. But, it also harms the parent. There are many people who are forced to stay home because they can't afford $1,200 a month for daycare. So, what happens then? Parents who have a child are forced to stay home and give up other economic and personal opportunities because they need to support their child.",constructive2,gabbishilcusky,round2,80.0,4

If they have some disease. This is particularly important for parents who come or for kids who come from low income or poorly educated parents who don't have the skills to identify some of the development issues they're facing. I think, also under this they get an education. So, we say that this has incredible future benefits. If you have an early education it provides you better for kindergarten and the rest of your education, which helps you lead into better career options or better jobs.

So, having this mom spend money that she would have spent on daycare on instead of getting a nursing degree so she can go help her society and help herself. Or, spending that money on her kids being able to go to college because of this investment. Secondly, the outside funding.

Keep in mind that the tax that they are describing is specifically a punitive one. That is that they concede that it is attempting to punish an action. That we think ought not be punished because it's not actually wrong.

The reason for this is because we think that especially with regards to personal home ownership. Keep in mind, yes, they talked about vacant homes, but the modeling that side government brought us. Was that, homes that are for personal use, that is the one you live in. Which is literally the one you occupy. Unless there was no better claim to being the rightful owner of it.

We don't think it's the case that because this tax has now come in. That suddenly everyone's going to be trying to sell their vacant homes and is going to suddenly flood the market, reducing the price. In fact, the PM concedes this, in his speech at the bottom.

Because they can hire better tax accountants or they can do all of the other crazy stuff that rich people do when tax codes have a bajillion different independent taxes. There are different loopholes to get around them, and now we are adding one more. We think that this means that there is no reason that they will be selling the houses.

Because of the numerous work requests filed, but the government literally does not have resources to fulfill any of those work requests.

Notice, and the nuance here is important. Notice that financial factors hinder the poor population from accessing both in the status quo. That's to say early childhood care may be scarce or expensive for these people, but universities are also very exorbitantly expensive. But importantly, notice also here that there are plenty of nonfinancial barriers to universities, to accessing universities. Things like the neighborhood in which you live in.

These universities tend to spend millions of advertising, not letting in financially disadvantaged children, and these universities are likely to overestimate their own value.

[OO 00:05:07] talks a little bit about this idea of family stability, but remember in our extension we tell you it's not just family stability, it's a good community ties, is that you could have a local store on the corner that someone tried to eventually own one day, and sort of build up that wealth that is helpful when that area eventually gets gentrified and you are able to sell that place for more money, but also the idea that you're able to build social capital, organizations and people being able to stay in the same place.",constructive3,jbotkin1,round1,80.0,4

You are forced to live in a place that's a really long commute away because that's only where the cheap rental properties are available and don't have any opportunity to go anywhere else. So when we do this rental versus home ownership comparison, we think that having the ability to own a home gives you a better access to eventually getting out of poverty, getting this upward mobility versus the idea of rent where you're forced into a situation where you're probably going to lose your job in the short term",constructive3,jbotkin1,round1,80.0,4

295,295,600,"Onto our case, first on the harms created by personal home ownership. We think that you should tax something when you doing that thing creates harms to society that you, yourself, may not feel. That's why we tax, for instance, cigarettes or alcohol because they create harms to society. Personal home ownership creates similar and then creates these X level harms. What are the harms? They are two main mechanisms. The first is the idea of permanence. The thing about personal homes is that once people buy them, they often never want to sell them, meaning that they are forever trapping that piece of land in their family's name forever.",constructive1,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4
296,296,602,"The second mechanism is about this zero sum nature of land, and what we mean by this is that you occupying this piece of land means that no one else can occupy it.",constructive1,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4
297,297,603,"This is a problem in cities with severe land shortage, which we think is a large portion of instances today, seeing is that more people moving into cities both in the U.S. and in developing countries as economies become more centralized and presents it around service based economies rather than manufacturing based economies. But this is a problem because populations increase faster than the amount of land supply there is. That's why there's housing price increases in all major cities around the world. This leads to homelessness, gentrification, people being driven out their homes. People not being able to afford rent, or even if they do afford rent, they can't afford anything else like education and healthcare and this is the major problem that we need to solve. How does personal home ownership exacerbate this problem? Because you owning that piece of land actively causes the amount of land available for every other person in that city to decrease.",constructive1,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4
298,298,604,"Meaning that every other person in the city, you're actively making housing more expensive. We also want to characterize this as situation, but people own more land or more land in their personal home than they need, right? Think of family homes that have been in the family for decades. You don't need 50 acres of land, but you continue to hold on to it because the housing deed's in your name. We want to incentivize people to sell land like that so then they can be more efficiently reallocated to people who need it, right? So how does our mechanism solve this works? The tax solves this because people are now incentivized to sell this piece of land because now the cost of maintaining that piece of land pay taxes and stuff is much less than the benefit of having a larger home for instance, or having a home that your family has lived in for a very long time.",constructive1,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4

There's much more fluidity of movement with rentals because if you, for instance, lose your job because there's a depression in your city. For instance, cities like Detroit or manufacturing cities that are slowly going out of business, you can easily just stop your lease like as long as you aren't on a lease for five years. Most rentals are short term, at least one or two years anyway and just move very easily.",constructive2,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4
303,303,610,"The second mechanism that we're going to use to improve people's lives is about the housing market being very volatile. The problem is that banks often give loans on housing to people who can't afford to pay them back. Why can't banks afford to do this? Because of the issue of spreading risk. They can afford to give loans to some people who will never be able to pay back their mortgage, and in fact, they actively try to give loans to these individuals so that they'll be able to foreclose those homes in the future and get assets back on them. That's okay for the banks because they give loads of loans to people, including some people can't afford it.",constructive2,kolyncheang,round1,80.0,4

Insofar as if you have one religious group of being discriminated against at one time, you actually don't know what the discrimination is going to be 10, 20 years from now, insofar as government coalitions shift, individual prejudices shift. So if you justify it in the short term by saying, ah, maybe this group is more oppressive towards women, well then you set a precedent that 20 years from now that different group is going to be empowered and oppressed in a different way.",constructive2,prestonj,round5,80.0,4
305,305,661,"Second thing we want to talk about is why the mechanism is uniquely good, why it's likely to be effective. So first of all, as I think op is going to agree to, this is a gigantic sum of funds. It's very unlikely that States are going to go against this insofar as their entire state economies in many instances are based in federal subsidies. Think about Iowa in terms of their other farm subsidies. We literally don't have the economy if the government, if the federal government doesn't intervene. But more specifically, we'll go further and tell you why the federal government uniquely is situated to do this.",constructive3,prestonj,round5,80.0,4
306,306,662,"Number one is that it's impartial in a way state governments are not. So there's no particular ties to a certain ethnic group most of the time because they're heterogeneous across the entirety of the country. This especially matters in places with hot ethnic tensions and regional conflicts, so a country like Mexico for example, where there's a lot of state tension. It's very important that in Mexico specifically there is an individual regional government making decisions about ethnic and religious liberty and rather as the federal government which is agglomerated across all of these interests, they're a lot more likely to be protected in the general case.",constructive4,prestonj,round5,80.0,4
307,307,663,"Second, is that federal governments are directly bound to constitutions in a way that state governments are not. These constitutions, in most instances explicitly instantiate the right to religious liberty, but many state constitutions are not binding in the same way, or governments can just ignore them with more impunity. It's very important that we adhere to the federal constitution and liberal democracies, which protect religious liberties. But third, we'd say courts aren't as effective, so alternate mechanisms of enforcement aren't as effective. First of all, there's massive resource constraints, there's a huge time delay, regional problems insofar as court systems differ across States, so it's not clear that you actually establish a longterm precedent. We can also say that these mechanisms are also probably downstream of our policies so courts are more likely to be protective of religious liberty if that's the overall government policy.",constructive5,prestonj,round5,80.0,4

Ultimately, those two decisions like individuals make on the basis of emotion and that is something that is a pre-requisite to the construction of society studies because the way you select standard bias, the way you detect, determine omitted variables are also a reflection of your subjectivity.",constructive2,elainehe,round3,80.0,4
309,309,723,"No, this is a pure misunderstanding of our argument. Our argument is that for better or worse, people do make decisions on the basis of their gut, right? This is the little reason why there isn't a rise in populism, despite all the evidence proving that protectionism is a really bad idea, that immigration is actually good for economic growth, that people aren't stealing your jobs. The simple fact of the matter is, regardless of what the statistics say people still feel differently, they believe living experiences tell them the opposite of the truth. When it comes to prioritizing what you think is more true, what you would directly experience verses what some elite university tells you is true, people always default to their living experience, right. This is the reason why the only way to actually get people on your side is to create some sort of human connection, so they have a willingness to listen to you and suspend disbelief for a second so you can actually prove your point. If it is actually treatable that good statistics, the way you make your statistics effective and you think in hearts and minds is to ensure they have a reason to care and listen to what you're saying in the first place and accompanying show some degree of humanness and empathy which may constitute as emotion.",constructive2,elainehe,round3,80.0,4

We think that first of all, this isn't in terms of what happened in terms of real change on the ground, despite the self proclaimed objectivity of the civil rights law, so we did not see actual changes in terms implementation of those laws until Secondarily, in terms of the civil rights copyrights, the reason why we even carry on asking the constitution questions is because they literally showed people marching and water gunning down children and so it wasn't emotional response that got people to suspend their racism and care for a second because they all agreed that we should care about the well being of children and the subjective nature of innocence being harmed.",constructive3,elainehe,round3,80.0,4
311,311,725,"First off, we think one of the most important results that happens from introducing low income individuals to access to university is we increase access to elite circles. University and post-secondary education is a prerequisite to accessing these circles and many places for a few reasons.
One, the connection that you made from university to individuals from the class are necessary to succeed in the class. Two, there are industry requirements, I.e. if you want to be an elite in business, you have to have a certain business degree to be able to get your introductory job. And three, the degree themselves acts as some kind of a signal of your capability to be involved with the elite class. University is in fact the tipping point at which a low income individual is able to join an elite class in some sense. I.e. people who are low income individuals are able to go to Oxford, still become judges, lawyers and politicians. The people that are able to have large scale implements. This is the most important impact in the round. If we're able to take even a small number of low income individuals that otherwise wouldn't have gone to university and put them into positions of power as policymakers, legislators and judges, those are people that now have the background to understand the issues that low income individuals face. Those are the people that are most likely to advocate for increasing funding that goes towards early child education and post-secondary education for low income students. Those are people that are creating the longterm change that they're trying to fight for. This is most important impact from the round.
One additional piece we think is important to point out is that government money that goes towards universities isn't just going towards the direct education themselves. It also has important spillover effects into research that we think are really critical. Particularly in non-profitable areas of research, there's a public policy, education and psychology that don't happen to your business impacts and lead to poor profit funders not funding them. Research in these areas only happens, even at really elite universities, where there's sufficient outside funding to fray the cost of hiring the researchers, hiring the students as RAs and having enough of a classroom teaching environment that they have the other university resources to be able to have powerful research departments in the first place. Having this research is incredibly important, I.e. access to information has a really high value. ",constructive1,thecactus,round2,80.0,4
312,312,740,"So first, about better economic policy. There's largely two reasons you've got this. First is I think you're getting more investment and more trade just because there's a lower currency risk when you have a centralized currency. There's two reasons for this case. First, internally there are zero currency risk. So when Thailand is trading with Cambodia when a business is investing in Cambodia, it means that the business does not have to worry that Cambodia's currency will collapse and all of their profits go to zero in a particular year. So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.
",constructive1,amspector100,round4,80.0,4
313,313,741,"So second, I want to talk about how you can get more stable monetary policy. That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability. That is to say, if there's more jobs for people, we think there's less political discontent. You're likely see the things like inflammation of the middle class and as a result, I don't know, it's just better",constructive2,amspector100,round4,80.0,4
314,314,742,"The second argument is about better economic and political integration. A couple of arguments on this. First, we think that with more trade you're likely to see more negotiating power for this block as a whole. That means that when China says, ""Hey Cambodia, we would like to do X, we would like to go on this particular Cambodia doesn't have to take the deal. Right? Cambodia isn't as... The ratio of power between Cambodia and China is still skewed to China side, but it gets better. So this means Cambodia can do things like incrementally advocate for better working conditions for people. It means it can incrementally advocate for slightly lower tariffs on its products so it can export things to China too. This is critical because, we think that these countries, especially if they're discussing to start a block, are smart enough not to dilute their comparative advantage, but at the same time ensure that there are basic guarantees of safety to things like their workers, like human rights and working conditions that are not available in these countries right now.",constructive3,amspector100,round4,80.0,4

331,331,382,"The problem is because the norm, generally whoever's going to be dominant in-group is always perceived as rational, these groups already have a blank card to use their emotional racism as much as possible. Because when they're being racist, or dealing with emotion, the norm excludes that because people say, oh, they're just being strong. People in a dominant group already have a blank check to be as racist as they want to the status quo because they're not being perceived as emotional. No thank you, it's also not your time. The only people who are perceived as emotional are the one who challenge it. Why is this important? Because this locks in Western status quo and countries and Western countries, it looks like the setting back of things like police reform because people who have the most to lose are always the ones who are in the most desperate situations. So they're seen as this. We're just why the American political compass is really, really okay of horrific things. Whereas that doesn't really happen in other countries, in weak democracies, this takes the place of truth. Minority groups demanding rights, being perceived as being a threat to stability of their fledgling political system. Because, even though their concerns are very be valid, because they've been gone lots of trauma and need to interject their own experiences for this trauma to make sense, they're going to be too emotional. This is why the U.S. and Western countries don't put pressure on terrible human rights abuses because they've perceived these minorities as being troublemakers and threats to order. Rather, as the group with an actual legitimate idea. This holds back the status quo altogether. Why does this agitate us to One, we don't rely on electoral victories. That hedges your bets on being able to get more people who like Hillary Clinton. Even if we don't get more minorities, we broadly shift the political spectrum and political discourse in a way that doesn't lock in the status quo against it. We affect all countries broadly without relying on winning elections.",constructive2,eslondon,round3,73.0,1
332,332,387,"To go into my positive material, emotion and subjective experience prevent your message from being listened to. We see this with movements like Occupy Wall Street. There's a movement in 2008 as a result of the financial collapse and the recession because of the corruption and deregulation of Wall Street that allowed the financial crash to happen. This is a protest movement where everyone rallied in the streets and they had drum circles going all day for weeks. There were people out camping. It was a huge protest movement, but it was ultimately unsuccessful because they failed to push their movement outside of the realm of emotion because people were hurt. People felt hurt because of the financial collapse, but they didn't bring any substantive policy change, and so nothing happened. They relied too much on how the collapse made them feel rather than what they were going to do about it. So it resulted in basically only drumming and riots and a general distaste and anger towards the system that they were trying to protest. We also see this with commentators like Ben Shapiro who make their careers off of quote, ""Dunking on liberal snowflakes."" These people use the emotions of their opponents, they cherry pick the people who are most emotional, who have the most emotional response to whatever he says. He makes them look like fools because their argumentation isn't there, and then he profits off of that even though he doesn't have to do any of the work. So we see from that, a lot of times emotional people have good points, but they're clouded by the emotional reaction and so no change ends up happening.",constructive1,kbatten,round3,73.0,1
333,333,388,"For my second point, I want to talk about how change happens. Let's talk about the anti-war protests in 1968 in Chicago. We saw the anti-war movement in much of the same way. A lot of times it was focused on the emotion of wanting to be free in a society that didn't want them to step out of line in a lot of ways, and also that wanted to end the war and end the government control that was forcing them into it. But these people, like in what Occupy Wall Street did not organize around that, they instead focused on the lifestyle changes they wanted to make and the anecdotal feelings of the members of the movement and how they felt towards the government that was oppressing them. So when you had those protests that were televised and the police brutality that happened, the movement was so focused on emotion and so unrelatable to most people in middle America who were seeing them on TV. A lot of people who couldn't relate to that movement because they didn't understand the argumentation rather than the points that they were trying to make. A lot of the people who saw that movement rallied for the cops, they enjoyed watching the hippies there get beat up and pepper sprayed and everything because they thought that it was just a bunch of emotional people who didn't want to fight for their country, who weren't patriotic or anything. They thought they were just people who were guided by emotion and not by reasoning. So we see that these people were not able to get their message across because of the emotion that so eclipsed their points. A lot of times movements based on emotion rather than substance and policy ideas push people away and render themselves moot by not clarifying what they actually believe in, what they actually want to have done. Emotion isn't enough to sway people to your cause. Concrete ideas are what actually makes change in these movements.",constructive2,kbatten,round3,73.0,1

We see one, they're going to have to move back into the cities, into apartments. Maybe they're renovated and like they're not rentals anymore.

347,347,650,"Our first argument is a principled argument about religious liberties and why we should protect them. So the first subsect of this argument is that we think that it's obvious that people should get religious liberties. We think that religious liberties are inalienable, and we think that it should be impossible to deny people those religious liberties. We think that doing otherwise would conflate church and state because when governments impose preventative rather than laissez faire rules on religious liberties, we think that those governments in doing so are imposing judgments on religions. Which they shouldn't do because that conflates church and state. And therefore, you risk public sovereignty, which is key to government and it's important. ",constructive1,meganwu,round5,73.0,1

We think that this is historically proven. For example, in India subnational governments that take cows away from Muslim people that have been sort of implicitly motivated by Hindu religious principles. We think that those value conflict over those laws have created religious tension as a result of conflating church and state. We think that laws that violate religious liberties generally, they backlash these laws, which spills over, beyond just the application of those laws. We think that the nature of religion is something that can unite people, which means that if a group of people receive the law as being sort of discriminatory or unjust to the group that they sort of operate within, then that sort of motivates backlash. Not just from the victim of the law, but for the entire group that that person represents, which means that backlash spills over and becomes a federal problem. ",constructive4,meganwu,round5,73.0,1
350,350,686,"So first, what I want to talk about in order to prove my other points, what you wear does portray image. That's why dress codes exist in workplaces, offices, uniforms, like clothing stores, why when you're in a professional business setting, you wear professional clothes to portray this image of professionalism and well qualification. That's why when you work in clothing retail stores, you dress fashion week, portraying this to your customers, that you have the authority and ethos to talk about this. So when you wear a religious symbol while you're working for the government, it puts forth the idea that the government supports this image and supports this religion, sports this religious symbol, as in all the ideals that come with this religion. This is inherently dangerous on an individual interaction level and on a larger government structural level in terms of politicians.",constructive1,rdames,round5,73.0,1
351,351,688,"When you see religious symbols, it is not necessarily a good thing, but it's something that happens in the status quo.

One, say you are someone who wants an abortion and so you go into your doctor and talk about this, but your doctor is wearing a cross. Obviously not all people who are Catholic are pro life or pro choice, but that thought does run through your mind, that it does say, wait, maybe I can't talk to my doctor about it.

So we think it is inherently dangerous when there is anything that takes away from their duty to do this, such as protect and educate citizens. This fear that comes from the associations that have to do with religion is inherently bad for the job, and the government. The federal government has an interest in their civil servants doing the job well because that's the job that they're hired to do.

So why is this the case? We think that first of all, the harms of recessions are extremely great. We think the collapse of the national economy leads to the overtaking or an infiltration of the IMF. Feel certain types of economic health memory now we think that the desire not to have one country go over is great enough to actually incentivize certain types of investment. Why do we think this is going to be more successful and more likely to occur? We think they desire to avoid recession means that that ostium will learn for the eurozone to actually be prepared for this type of situation and avoid the bailout situation ever needing to occur. Why is this the case? We think the countries are able to like for example, compile experts that are able to negotiate the different calculuses of the different countries that might need to set higher interest rates or lower interest rates depending on the internal situations with the countries that if you don't have these intimately tied currency you don't have the incentive to do this. You only have the incentive to hammer out bargains that are more advantageous to your side right now. Whereas, we think that the role in which your currency is tied to the currency of a country that might need there to be lower interest rates. You might actually be billing to conceive this. We think you create a collective knowledge base that enables you to balance interest in much more efficient way. We think because you have not only interest in doing this, but you have the institutions that are dedicated to doing this. You have the infrastructure and expertise to actually dedicate to creating this kind of collective interest and actualizing it. We think you are able to better create balance as you as a whole, especially prioritizing nations that were never prioritized before. When nations that had more economic development, more economic growth, more political power, were the ones that are going to dominate. We think that in the world in which those countries are dependent economically on the actual success of these smaller nations that are worse off, we think they are more likely to actually care. We think that you created a collective interest in the growth of these countries.

354,354,748,"So what we say to this is first a little bit of modeling, what we think this actually looks like is much more stories, anecdotal evidence, et cetera, et cetera. Then the narrative that's being pushed out today, which is like more data, more objectivity is better for any policy. We think that this looks like a model of utilitarianism and this is exactly what opposition is going to have to contend with. But what we do say and in our first point is the influence of perspective on politics. We say humans are naturally subjective creatures. The opposition is going to tell you that this is naturally a bad thing. What we tell you is this is important in so far as we need perspective on politics. We say our limitation is vastly depending on your background, especially of what type of arguments you make, but also specifically how you feel about those arguments and how you feel about that political debate because we think that this extends beyond the realm of just numbers and how this affects you on the economic level or how does it affect you physically. But we think that it also has some emotional and mental value in what politics actually does to you. We think that your ethnicity, your social economic background and the community that you come from, et cetera and your geography that you come from are all important factors in how you argue and also the perspective that you bring to politics itself. Because we do think that on a national scale, national scope, for example, federal level politics does play a huge role differently on how money gets allocated or how the impacts go depending on the geographic geography, but also the individual like the ethnicity, the socioeconomic background you have in relation to the government who is actually making these policies itself, who's having these political debates.",constructive1,vchaluv,round3,73.0,1
355,355,749,"And I'll get into that more because we think that even in that point, we think it's important to have some sort of influence on these people. Because we don't think that first off, all of these people's subjective accounts can be taken out of the realm of these political debates. But even then we think that this pushes liberal policy more towards the fact that you're going to have people who are taking into consideration these subjective accounts and these people who have actually historically haven't had the voice in these political systems, but now with these subjective measures, these anecdotal evidence, they do have more of an effect on how the politics can be played out.",constructive1,vchaluv,round3,73.0,1
356,356,751,"But finally the effect of the real world. So what happens when you walk out of the debate? So even outside of the fact that if you get political change or novel, we do say, is that understanding the gravity of the situation or how it's being debated is just as important as understanding what the benefits and harms are. Because we say that the way you're being debated or the way that these communities are being talked about in the political realm is not currently how they want to be talked about. We think that you have much more ability for that community to actually change the political atmosphere and change how the political realm talks about them in so far as they are the ones who are having the narrative, having the ability to push out their subjective experiences, that they're able to have their anecdotal evidence actually used in this matter and understand the gravity of the situation. We say that finally, that the circle of empathy is essential for any political change. So we do say that, at the end of the day, the weighing mechanism you're going to be using, that the idea of the fact that even before we get any logos or we get any achievement or before we get any objective measure, what they have to understand is you have to care about the people that this is actually affecting in the first place. Because we say that the circle of empathy only relays to your friends, your family, and their closest people. However, what we hear is that from subjective experiences, you get more perspective and you get more of this idea of dignity and not impact. We think that's important in so far as you can understand other perspectives and you can increase your circle of empathy and understand why these people actually need objective impacts in the first place.",constructive3,vchaluv,round3,73.0,1
357,357,754,"First off, my contention number on is that objectivity is necessary to the political process. In the United States, for example, or just Western liberal democracy in general, which I believe that we agree is kind of the scope of the debate, we can see that when we're making policy that applies to the macro level, we absolutely need to know the wide scale objective changes that are going to occur as a result of our policy. One person's experience in relation to this policy should not be something that outweighs the objective statistical values that are achieved through this policy. For example, one of the things that we're doing right now is... An argument is common in America these days, to basically say that, ""Well, there are problems with this policy because it's going to make life harder for a select few individuals."" But they seem to ignore on the other side of that policy is that it's making it easier for millions of Americans to live in a different way. I don't have a policy to specifically list off the top of my head, but this kind of emotional manipulation is used in politics. Pathos is absolutely abused across the media where they're talking about conservatives, republicans, or socialists and democrats. We can see that the pathos of an argument is abused rather than simply taking the objectivity of the options here.",constructive1,wylywalker,round3,73.0,1
358,358,755,"I want to go ahead and move down to my contention number two, is that singular experiences manipulate the process. One of the things that we can see again in Western liberal democracy, is oftentimes we can, as the governments of Western liberal democracy, that bad decisions are made when emotions are high. We can see this time and time again throughout history. One of the examples that I'd like to bring up is countries in Europe accepting too many refugees. Now, I don't want to say that we should be accepting refugees in. It's simply that they look at a situation and they say, ""We want to help out."" Then when emotions are high, they make the decision to open their border completely. An example of this is in Germany. There are certain districts of the country that there is massive cultural clash because the Western liberal mindset of most of the people that live in Germany is clashing with a foreign culture that they're not experienced with. This isn't to say that either culture is bad. It's simply saying that the cultures are less compatible than what is ideal. It ends up becoming a massive problem because there's lot of cultural clash. Even someone like Angela Merkel, who was for the Open Borders Policy, says that she regrets making the Open Borders Policy. Again, we can see here that singular experiences manipulate governments into making bad policy decisions.",constructive2,wylywalker,round3,73.0,1
359,359,798,"We think though, that there's a second thing here and I think this is a point of characterization, right? We think that the gap in terms of state funding can easily be filled by alumni who get to see their school, What preschool did you go to? Can you tell me its name? I think not. When was the last time somebody donated to the preschool they went to? Right? That doesn't happen. But alumni love pouring money in droves. We think that universities can very easily say, Hey, what, we're losing money, we're losing grant money. We're not going to get the best and brightest students. Give us money and very easily they're going to be able to get that from either corporations that want to see the best and brightest trained so that they can go out into the workplace and contribute to those companies and we're going to see alumni who see their colleges in crisis knowing that they're not going to get access to the best scholars because they're going to get taken away by the schools with massive endowments and they're going to give money so that you still have access to those universities.T he state is not necessary to fund universities. Other actors can fill those gaps. But the state is necessary to fill daycare because people don't donate to it. Corporations aren't like aching over it because they don't know. Microsoft doesn't know if funding a preschool is going to get them the next best computer programmer. They know that funding a state college to have more programmers is going to allow them to actually select that pool of talent. We think therefore that that has to be a better replacements.

And I don't think rich people are super ingroup with the rich people. They're like, Aha, I must subsidize my friends schooling. Right?

If you act contrary to your religion, which you have deeply, deeply believed in, you are possibly subjecting yourself to eternal damnation, right? We think that this is believed in the vast majority of cases. Religious belief is the most important, right? And always takes precedence over everything else. This then means that these things not only has an obligation to protect it, but also that it supersedes the rights that they have talked about, which we don't think are likely to be violated anyway. Because again, everyone is just going to comply.",constructive5,kflynndo,round5,77.0,3
366,366,88,"aving banded together as a country or as a block, increases the strength of your currency, which means that have a little control over that currency, which means that the West actually trades less with you. Note that this happened, the status quo, in situations like China when people accuse China of being a currency manipulator. It made the currency weaker, so people were incentivized to trade with it. Note that when you lose that control and make your currency stronger, the West will trade with you less, and that's a huge economic cost to do the entire block. Okay, cool. I think that those, those harms significantly outweigh all the other benefits that happen.",constructive2,samuelwu,round4,77.0,3
367,367,121,"So going first to the first question, like crystallizing questions and who are you talking about? comes at a bunch of angles. They say that the super rich will buy a bunch of homes, which I think is one unrealistic. I don't think that just because a bunch of people can no longer afford homes in like Columbia, South Carolina, I don't think Taylor Swift is just go buy a bunch of things. I think realistically, we have to contend that this is mostly talking about the relationship between the upper and lower middle class and the impoverished renter group of America and why that's...I don't think that the 1% where they fall into that so I think that part of the analysis comes out. But I also think that in part they talk about how lower middle class people can buy homes for good investment.",constructive1,tcarrou,round1,77.0,3
368,368,122,"So question two, how does renting change generational wealth and buy homes? I think this was really where my partner takes it home, because he explains the heart of this motion. How home ownership is exactly linked to the stagnate, economic situation we see all across the world, specifically in America and Canada and whatnot. My partner brought to you explicit analysis about how, when you have a home, you are no you are better able to get access to like loans, money stable like Elliot's liquid. He grants you all these amazing examples and all these details explanations about how this wealth transitions forward. And I think that takes us over because I think a lot of those things about why and how historical there's a protest and that leads to a principal.",constructive2,tcarrou,round1,77.0,3
369,369,123,"So frankly we need to ask ourselves is who is failed most by the status quo. We say that the working poor in the United States are failed most by the education system. Right? Because of the fact that there is no universal childcare or daycare right now, these people who oftentimes have to have both parents, if there are even two parents of a household working at one time, necessarily need daycare because of, no thank you. The fact that they're actually going to be, because of the fact that both parents need to work because they need this money more than anyone. They cannot afford not to work. Why is this a problem? Because there are massive costs to private daycare that exists right now.",constructive1,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
370,370,125,"We think this is important because in this round and generally the education system, governments offer education because they want to try and empower people to have better lives and provide for themselves. Right? The other thing is that if you sort of move this burden of costs back further in life, the child is much more able to work part-time, don't have to be able to afford something like university or trade school, but if you're a kindergartner, you probably can't work part time to pay for your part of your daycare. I think uniquely people are just generally more able to get a better balanced education when you push this cost back, people are better off.",constructive1,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
371,371,126,Second thing I want to talk about is why we need to prioritize early childhood care. First I want to talk about today the socialization of early child education because when you're interacting with peers and things like daycare or pre-K at an early age and then being at home or being pushed back and forth between whichever family member or friend you know that can help.,constructive2,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
372,372,127,"You generally have no sort of routine if you're not familiarized with things like structure order, things like that. Two forms of familiarization. One, when talking about familiarization with peers. If you are with say a grandparent all day, or with any sort of family friend who's there to help you while your parents work, you're not going to be around things like your peers. This is bad because when children are not exposed to this, once they are entered in public school, which is generally sort of lower quality because of the way that American public schools are funded by property taxes, so low income children already attend lower quality schools in the first place. But generally this is magnified because now by the time they get to these schools, once they're in kindergarten, when public school becomes free and the status quo, suddenly they've had much less exposure to socialization; they're less able to grow, interact with their peers, or learn cooperatively as opposed to state children in middle-class neighborhoods, or children who attend wealthy private schools, whose parents have already provided them something like daycare or nursery school, who are much better off. They learn by example of directed peers.",constructive2,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
373,373,128,We think sort of socializing at an earlier age. It leads to better interactions as they sort of progressed because they've had more time to become used to social norms that might be unfamiliar or perhaps scary to a small child. That's technically why we think secondary education is more valuable. It is familiarity with education in and of itself.,constructive3,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
374,374,129,"We say this is necessary. Why? Because when children who've had not received secondary early childhood care entered schools in the status quo, there oftentimes trapped to things like remedial education because unlike some of their peers who may have been wealthier and able to afford daycare or pre-K, these children are not. It sort of shows that they sort of perform behind even if they aren't necessarily meeting standards perceptually because they aren't doing as well as their peers. It gives teachers an incentive to try and trap them back into the worst classes or even sort of hold them behind. Right. Limit their ability to educate themselves further. Also just keeping them in house longer. Keeping him time away from like being able to grow up, get a job, do better off. We prevent this necessarily because what you should have more socialized with the idea of education of",constructive3,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
375,375,130,"When you get to pre-K, it's much less frightening, much less unfamiliar. So you sort of have the reason why the program right now it's called the Headstart. We give more children, a headstart because we sort of solve back for the gaps and funding right now. Right. Why are these important? Because both of these spill over to future adult outcomes. Throughout your life you're always able remember things, but as an early childhood, your brain is most malleable and most open to availment. We say if you're going to try and socialize people, but you should try and do it as early as possible. If you want children to become familiar with interacting with the peers, familiar with their schools, and have trust in the overall system, sort of enthusiasm and opportunity in school. It's not true that you can simply wait for him to learn this in kindergarten because by then just a few years matter so much at an early age, that",constructive3,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
376,376,131,"the developmental psychology has already one, been warped by getting away from your peers for like 2 years, but two, also they're just less open because like early childhood brains are just so malleable. now why is this important? Because we say this will lead to better life outcomes and better ability for these children to actualize. Why is that the case? Because when you're sort of more familiar with schools, or, better comfortable with your peers, you care about school or I think you can be enthusiastic about education, get better grades, feel like you have a place in your school and you not have a reason to drop out. This is why drop out rates are so abysmal - or rather- so high in low income areas right now. We sort of solve that for this by staring at the root cause, the children and feeling alienated and unfamiliar with school. It's just super important because one, this would lead to sort of better life outcomes, a more optimal target. But two, it's impossible for you to access things like secondary education, and to have any value over people, if there's literally high drop out rates that stop college from ever helping people coming from low income areas.",constructive3,eslondon,round2,77.0,3
377,377,168,"First of all, we stop prioritizing housing as an asset that leads to a more meaningful life. We think that this is the largest asset that most people will own in their entire lives.

We tell them to stop making these sorts of risky decisions and open the door for them to do more like sustainable asset buying and to save for the future.

380,380,171,"Second extension here, we stop predatory loan practices for two reasons. We think first of all, banks tend to target people of color and the poor with predatory loving practices like we saw before the 2008 housing crisis. This looks like giving risky loans to people they know can't pay them back. This looks like banks buying off CDOs for lower and lower prices. We think this is a really good thing because we stop the risk of economic collapse for the entire economy. We're also limiting the harm that is going to happen to those individuals. We think that we limit the potential for a huge increase in inequality when the economy does and now that we have some sort of debt and we just make sure that these people are not the people who are being targeted by an economy that is guaranteed to not remain stable.",constructive2,susieg,round1,77.0,3
381,381,172,The second thing here is we tell you that higher density housing typically is a really good thing. We tell you that with this massive increase in supply of housing comes when people are switching buildings over to apartments that are up for rent. You tend lower prices because these corporations are simply interested in renting to as many people as they possibly can. We think that this is a really good thing.,constructive2,susieg,round1,77.0,3
382,382,173,"Third, the point here is gentrification. We think that we see this especially in areas where people often do own their own homes. This looks like smaller cities in the US and Europe. This looks like cities like Portland and Seattle, where poor and people of color are being pushed out of the neighborhoods where they live for generations, because people are able and willing to come in and buy the homes from them, because there is no sort of disincentive not to do so. We think that this is really, really bad, because we drive the poor out to cheaper, shittier housing outside of cities. You increase the time that it takes them to get to work every day. You force them to be more concerned with making sure their housing remains stable and making sure that they're able to even get to their jobs to make any sort of money.",constructive3,susieg,round1,77.0,3

Allows them to live their lives to their full potential and actually opens the door for some sort of social mobility in the long run.

So you feel like this is important because it's not only just the fact that it's a building block, but it's important in allowing these kids to stay in school in the future. And why is that specifically important? How we'll link that key to importance in the education system? And it's not like they're treating their kids like customers. It's like they will have more resources and a better know how of how to cater to specific types of children if they're more of those types of children going to these schools. Which means that if you have, say 300 instead of 50 people from a certain area or certain population or socioeconomic bracket going to your school, you're going to have probably child psychologists for them.",constructive1,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
386,386,190,"Because these children are going to be facing specific problems that you really cater to as a school, just because that's your job, not because they're your customers, because it's your job, you kind of like provide a certain level of education to everybody. And if you feel like some people are not being able to access it, you will develop more tools to allow them to access that kind of education, which is why, as a whole, your education system would improve not only at the primary level, but more kids will make it because these are facilities developing in the long run, at a primary level, more kids are probably going to make it to secondary school. And later to high school. We feel like we're the only team in this entire room that actually shows you how these specific people in these specific socioeconomic brackets actually end up getting from Pre-K to high school.",constructive1,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
387,387,191,"But secondly, let's talk to you about the barriers to entry for these children to these higher education institutions. So, for instance, our entire argument about how this would help uplift the caregivers from the cycle of poverty. And this isn't just on the level of an economic level, i.e., to have more time to work more jobs, or they're able to accrue more as a result to which they're more likely to invest more time in their children, but also invest more time or collect more money for their leader education. But it's also the fact that money isn't the primary barrier for these children to end up going to higher education institutions. It's the motivation, both on parts of parents but both on parts of these children.",constructive2,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
388,388,192,"It's motivation in the sense that most of these children didn't see education as something worthwhile, because they didn't learn that at a primary level. As a result, they didn't end up continuing education. And how does that end up happening more in our side? Because I feel like the reason why these children will end up going to college, and especially in developing countries, and here's where I talk about that very distinction, is because most of them don't really receive primary education. This isn't like a family education wasn't good enough. It's because these countries actually lack properly developed primary education system. It's as he said, what kind of education are you going to receive if the roof of your school is falling over your head, which is exactly why we feel like we need to divert more resources into making sure that doesn't happen for majority number of people in our country.",constructive2,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
389,389,194,"So what actually ends up happening? You have some people becoming doctors or lawyers, but they never really mechanize or showed us how these doctors or lawyers and these people access these education are going to have an incentive to come back and reinvest in these communities given that they're coming from certain higher socioeconomic brackets in the first place. Even if that anomaly ends up going to college and becoming a doctor or a lawyer, the fact that their own country isn't able to provide higher social mobility for them, leads to them leaving their country, which leads to all the negative impacts they talked about anyways. So how are we actually doing away with this? We're doing away with this because we have more schools, which means we only have better quality of schools and education programs that you have these people staying in school because they have better peer to peer interaction, better social groups, and more of a desire to stay in schoo",constructive2,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
390,390,195,"But how does it actually happen in the long run for ours? Because especially in developing countries, there's actually more demand for university education, given that a larger number of children are being educated in your school and are environmentally at a primary level and are actually staying through all the stages of the education system, there's more demand for universities.",constructive3,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
391,391,196,"Setting up universities and giving some people subsidy to go to these universities, is not going to net increase the education, education, these countries as a whole. And why is that good, specifically for socialization and interaction? Because you have a larger diversity of the kinds of children that are eventually able to access these higher level education institutions, which means on that you have more people from certain socioeconomic brackets ending up at these universities, which not only leads to more different types that people in these universities, but more interaction between different socioeconomic classes within your society. Which will on that lead to better policy making in the future because you went to school with the son of someone who was in the village, and that will continue to happen more and more. And hence we're more likely to want to make for him in the future",constructive3,amaanianam,round2,77.0,3
392,392,212,"Okay, so firstly, why do people on houses? I don't think it's because they're entirely bought into this idea of an American dream of owning a house. But rather, I think that for a lot of people, even minority communities especially, is because they desire stability first and foremost.",constructive1,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
393,393,213,"Because there's many examples in status quo of people being driven out of rented apartments, because we tell you that basically back in the '80s or in the '60s really for a large part of the black community, they were forced systematically out of rented apartments, that when white landowners desired to push them out, they they would find reasons to force them out of those apartments and just find bullshit reasons to could drive them out.",constructive1,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
394,394,215,"Okay. But more than that, what happens is that if you don't believe, just like in minorities communities back then, it happens now in status quo, with things like rent controlled apartments, where landlords can be like, ""Look, my family member is moving into this apartment,"" and then force people out or other shitty measures like that.",constructive1,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
395,395,216,"Because when you own that apartment or you own that condo, that protects you from those laws and it prevents you from having to uproot your life because someone else desires it. I think that that stability and that desire for stability is fundamentally should be protected in status quo.",constructive1,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
396,396,217,"Secondly, we're going to talk about finance here. Because I think that how people view housing as finance and investments is actually really important. So firstly I think that, note that instead of attempting at policies to attempt to deflate a bubble by saying making housing more regulated as an industry, they would rather pop the entire bubble itself and cause a housing crash, because that's what suddenly introducing taxes would do. And when you attempt to do it for punitively, that the fact is even worse.",constructive2,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
397,397,220,"When it's no longer worth that money, then their finances are ruined. They're literally ruining the finances for millions of lives by introducing the tax punitively. Okay. So I think that that in and of itself is just straight up not worth it. I don't think that any measure is worth ruining the lives of millions of people.",constructive2,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
398,398,221,"we think that even if it was some sort of soft measure that came in here and it wasn't punitive, that it still punishes the middle class heavily. Because how does like ours, a large part of familiar wealth, and they're a large part of how people build generational wealth. Because the thing is that if you rent, which is the only appliable option under [Gov's 00:04:56] world, then what happens is that you're essentially giving money to the rich land owners.",constructive3,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
399,399,222,"You're giving them the value of that land. And that means that it's very difficult for communities, and especially poor people, but also middle class people, to actually then build generational wealth for themselves, because of the large part of inheritances in status quo, are tied to housing and ownership. So in that way, you decreased a major mechanism to actually pass on generational wealth in status quo.",constructive3,samuelwu,round1,77.0,3
400,400,223,"So to explain the principle of agency a little bit more deeply. We say that people deserve control of their life and things that are important in their life, yes, but what is most important in your life is things that you fundamentally associate with yourself, your own identity and your expression.",constructive1,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
401,401,224,"So your control over maybe your car, which is a utility used on a daily basis, is not necessarily the same.

Why do we say that this is the case?",constructive1,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
402,402,226,"Now there may be limits some on the things that the landlord can change based on tenants rights legislation, but you still don't have complete authority over your own home, right? You can be evicted. You can have people arbitrarily come to your apartment at any point. You can have price increases year over year that you do not know what they are going to be. Even with strong tenant protection laws, all this is still in the case... is still the case.",constructive2,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
403,403,227,"So, we say that this is a fundamental difference. Mortgages are not the same as renting. A mortgage gives you certainty and security, rentals do not. So what do we say some of the deep harms of renting are? So first let me say, there's a sense of servitude inferiority that unfortunately comes with something that is so intrinsic to your identity that it's essential to your sense of self, being put under the control of someone else for no better reason than that they were born into money and privilege in most cases. We see that people who do not have money are forced to tie something fundamental to their identity, fundamental to their life, their home, and put it under the power of somebody else. So that just tells someone that things which important to them and their identity can be controlled by someone else. They don't have full control over things that they care about. And we say that that's a disempowering feeling and they say that that makes people feel unhappy and that gives them a sense of lack of control in their lives.",constructive2,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
404,404,228,"Secondly, we say there's a sense of insecurity and fear that comes when something essential to your identity and your place of security can be arbitrarily severed at any time, by eviction or by rent increases you can't... afford. Excuse me. So we say it reduces your ability to enjoy your home, that place where you're supposed to be able to express your identity and feel a sense of safety, when you constantly have to be terrified that it might be taken away from you at a moment's notice.",constructive2,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
405,405,229,"Thirdly, we say there are massive traumas to eviction. If you're evicted from your property, then particularly children whose sense of identity may be tied to a place and have known no other home, will be deeply traumatized by that event. Forced to move away from everything they know, from their friends and schools, family and things like that. So we say that these are deep harms that do not exist nearly to the same extent in homeownership as they do in tenancy. There are still harms to homeownership and it's never a perfect world, but we say tenancy gives you far more control and is a preferable thing to creating the most personal agency for people that's possible",constructive2,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
406,406,230,"Secondly, it's important to recognize that wealthy renters are still going to want to keep poor people out of their neighborhoods, not for the sake of property values, but for the sake of prejudices against poor people thinking that they bring crime, et cetera. So the exact same problems exist on their side of the house with regards to housing affordability. Next... So we tell you that they aren't able to solve the problem of housing ability on their side of the house. How do we solve housing affordability for real? So we say there need to be aggressive zoning reforms, tax credits to development, et cetera, that need to be led on a national level further from local influences. This is what was done in Japan. And they say that in the developed world, the rate of inequality and housing prices are increasing in every society, but that's not true. In Japan housing prices have been declining for the last 30 years consistently because they've done the exact things that I've referenced, even though they have a system of private homeownership.",constructive3,rowanley,round1,77.0,3
407,407,274,"So I'll talk about financial stability. Quick reframing, regarding opening government. We want to prioritize on opening government, how the government would interact with people, right? We think that the rate of the motion is totally valid and so it's the decision that a parent would make based on what the prime minister said. On closing government, you hear a specific characterization about the government making the decision, where do we invest our money? Right? We don't think this is enough. We think this is a different rate of motions that are both compatible within themselves.",constructive1,idonotad,round2,77.0,3
408,408,275,"First, why do we help people more? In the short term, we support working parents. I talked about that in my engagement opening, but essentially, we think working parents are one of the most vulnerable people in this situation because their decisions and the way that they balance their time and their attention will inevitably change the way that their child grows. This looks like two things. In more vulnerable communities, the attention that they give to the children, is implicitly connected to their safety, because a parent needs to be very attentive to the child. That child needs to be safe, because a child cannot be at home alone in a neighborhood that is dangerous because the parents don't have the financial stability to move them into a safer neighborhood. Because a daycare is very effective and because of that, access to a school that is safe with getting communities... They live with gates and police officers from the city is very safe and that means that they have the reassurance that the child is safe. And they don't have to worry about that.",constructive1,idonotad,round2,77.0,3
409,409,277,"So directly affecting parents, we help them. How does this benefit stability? Two ways, right? First of all, we think it affects the way that parents, in the second, can directly be benefited by the government. We think that this investment benefits the parents themselves and as opening governments, opening oppositions. That's reinvesting, therefore, into the economy by increasing our activity on behalf of the parents. But secondly, we also think that the parents... The children do have better access to education because when the children can focus on education and have their attention directed to that and then come home to loving and supporting parents that don't have to stress or worry about the safety of their child, we think the children do have that bond to education that will inevitably help them up.",constructive2,idonotad,round2,77.0,3

Therefore, making them totally ineligible for the track for education that this opposition suggests.

That we have in this set of school, right?",constructive3,idonotad,round2,77.0,3
413,413,281,"We think that is insufficient. We think if poorer communities were to be given the attention and the resources that they need and deserve in order to be actual prosperous members of society, and not to be disenfranchised, just by virtue of where they were born or where their parents could afford to live or how much attention their parents can afford to give them.

This, post-secondary education is where students are introduced to society and their role in society both economically when they learn a specific trade or a specific major of study and they go into that major of study and learn how they fit into the workforce and socially when they learn how they fit in society and how they can be a productive member of society.",constructive1,arjunp,round2,77.0,3
415,415,311,"Additionally, self actualization, which is the highest part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is achieved during post-secondary education. You learn who you are and what you can offer to society and what value you have as a human being. That's a key part that children in a Pre-K education are not sophisticated or old enough to understand, but in a post-secondary education system, kids can achieve that. The comparative here that if we don't fund Pre-K education more than current levels, students will still learn reading and basic social skills. But if we take away money from a posting education, essentially kids who cannot afford these schools will be drawn out of the will not learn any of these valuable skills and they will not be able to get a spot in the economy and future workforce because posting education is a lot more expensive.",constructive1,arjunp,round2,77.0,3
416,416,312,Our second argument that there's no regulation or accountability for Pre-K education compared to post-secondary education.,constructive2,arjunp,round2,77.0,3
417,417,313,"The DOE regulates K–12, but Pre-K is largely unregulated by the DOE. This means that all these schools, all these Pre-K organizations that wants to pour money into, they have very little regulations, very little transparency and there's a lot of room for corruption. Public universities on the other hand are either run by the state, which means that they have the supervision and oversight of a state and of a government or they're accredited, which means they have the supervision of an independent body to make sure they are fulfilling education properly.",constructive2,arjunp,round2,77.0,3
418,418,314,"None of this exists in the Pre-K system. Why does this matter? It means that investing in the Pre-K system exacerbates inequalities. Poor students will be going to Pre-K system that do not have oversight and do not have effective programs. While the rich students will continue to go to good Pre-K programs. So essentially no level inequality is solved by giving more money to Pre-K but rather the rich students get good at good programs and the poor students of... The rich students go to good programs and the poor students go to bad programs. This should ethically be rejected on a principle matter because it means at the government's model, essentially sanctions, inequality and sanctions further divide between the rich and the poor in the U.S when the very role of education is supposed to be an equalizer and something where someone can go from one socioeconomic level to a higher socioeconomic level.",constructive2,arjunp,round2,77.0,3
419,419,315,"Our third main argument is that post-secondary education is key to workforce pipelines that sustain aid the economy of nations such as the U.S and be individual upward mobility. Trade and emergencies are key to sector shortages. For example, in the cybersecurity industry, there's a shortage of qualified workers who can work there if we invested in Pre-K, we are not necessarily filling these shortages, but if the government invests in things like cybersecurity training schools or schools that focus in tech, we are filling these shortages that are key to the economy. If we have a shortage in a specific industry or a sector that essentially mean that sector will not be able to produce innovation, which is the internal link to economic growth in the long term.",constructive3,arjunp,round2,77.0,3

If we don't actually fund these schools and give students opportunity to have scholarships and financial aid, which is where a lot of this public funding is going to, these students will not be able to go to these trade schools, go to these specific schools and learn a skill that can bring them out of poverty.

But what we tell you is that this exists as a check, as a nagging voice in the back of your head that tells you, ""You know what? No, I need to look at the objective reality."" We think that leads to better impacts. Let's talk about that half a little bit as well. So back half tries to give this about like dealing immigrants, right? We think that this power narrative still applies because when you're dealing with narratives about immigrants, you have two very competing narratives. One is completely true, one is completely untrue about criminals, like immigrants being criminals versus immigrants being poor and struggling, right? We think that when the empiric that goes into that, it becomes far more valuable. Okay, so let's talk about our impacts. We have three really big impacts for you, that I think really lends us. The first one was voting, right? We think we get better voting. What we hear from them is this idea of, economic favor ability, right? People vote in their economic interests. That's why people vote right way. We would tell you that this is actually not true. And if people were listening to objective fact, that they would understand that Donald Trump has massively raised the deficit, increased taxes for the wealthy, and lowered taxes for the wealthy and increased taxes for them. Right? They wouldn't let that. But the narrative, the emotional rhetoric is that the right wing is the fiscally responsible group that's going to help you with your taxes. Right? But we think that looking objectively, you change that. We also get our big and past, are unresponded to about how to get better policy making, just by the value of the empirical reality. And we get better discourse in terms of those shorter election cycle, meaning more engagement in real fact.",constructive1,magagne,round3,77.0,3
425,425,376,"So first, how do these feelings lead to this polarization? We believe that pole populism is solely about polar, like solely about feeling and manipulating those feelings against certain groups. We believe that populism is about feelings that create in groups and out groups, in which the ingroups suppress the minority and suppress the outgroups and oppress them. We believe this is a net harm and we believe this is something that we see in the status quo, in which we have a world that cares so much about subjective politics over objectivity. In fact, we believe in their world, they have the rise of populous leaders across the world, and we think that we need to combat that by caring more about that. We believe that this is a net harm when you get populous leaders because they harm these minorities, who they say they are working for by getting empathy and compassion. We believe that that argument is therefore counter intuitive, because they are creating populous leaders on their side of the House, who, I mean there are people who lack empathy and lack compassion, and we believe that that is a net harm, that we don't bring you on our side of the House. We believe that things should be done to prevent the rise of these populous leaders, because we believe they give a net harm to society, but disagrees. Given that by oppositions of the framework, if people who have implicit biases are already less ... have less of a tendency to care about these minorities, why would these facts be more likely to sway them, better than empathy for the people who are suffering within these conditions? We don't think people shouldn't have empathy, but we don't think necessarily politics and talking about politics is the way to teach people empathy. We believe that you have empathy that is taught to you throughout your life and you can apply that to the facts you are given. When we tell you that racism is a public health issue, which I'm going to talk about, we see that people have empathy for people like, such as like, black mothers who have a much higher mortality rate than white mothers do in this country. We believe they have empathy for that, but they also see that the facts are inherently wrong, and they should apply the empathy they have outside of that to the facts given, which is there is a much higher mortality rate for POC mothers than white mothers in the United States. We believe that this is the kind of applying the empathy you already have to facts given to you that is going to bring us this debate on our side that helps. We don't believe that you shouldn't have empathy at all, but we don't believe that you should base politic- that leaders should pander to you with emotions, and tell you the emotion you should feel about policies. We believe you should come up with those by your own, based on the facts we're given in the situation.",constructive1,pbissail,round3,77.0,3
426,426,385,"How then does this actually operate? Three currents of analysis. First, how the right cooperates or co-ops emotional negativity. First, we talk about things like the abortion. We say because of the facts that it's all subjective on their side of the house, that people can not just stand on the facts in and of itself. I tell you when abortion is necessary for women who just need to have the agency of their own body, but people are saying the child itself is dying, that's murder. That's problematic when they use that as the only narrative by which you can access things like the right pushing for things like getting rid of abortion laws. I mean those are things they have to deal with where they can just bring people into these things. Empirically, it shows that abortions are safer and they're much better for the women on the whole and for the child being brought into this world. But people subjectively think that if I think that a baby is being murdered, that is bad. There's no degrees of analysis. It's just purely based on an empathetic link.",constructive1,mshah4523,round3,77.0,3
427,427,386,"Yeah, so what if our best analysis for climate change leads to the world being safe for climate change? These are all purely theoretical thought processes. There's a lot of ways that this can be engaged. We think specifically, even in the case of some people may be hurt, we think empirically, on the whole the data would show things could be better on the whole. So how then do we actually think this happens when emotions aren't enough? First we think that what happens when people think emotions are enough is that you pour out everything and nothing happens This happens to the people on an individualistic level. We're like, ""I feel like I've given testimonies on things and nothing happens."" We think that people feel ignored. They feel alienated and they feel invalid. The thing is if you're relying on these people to use their lived experiences that have weaponized them against other individuals, then you're literally just using them in hopes that you can get some large scale change. We think that's problematic on the whole, because people are always going to see they're too emotional. They can't see clearly. We look at things like the March for Our Lives that produce a lot of backlash because people are like, ""They're doing nothing and they're kind of irrelevant."" We think that's problematic on the whole when that's kind of narrative that we have.",constructive2,mshah4523,round3,77.0,3
428,428,394,"he first argument is on the benefits of a home. We agree with government's framing that who does this tax affect? This tax uniquely affects people who are on the precipice. Who would not be able to buy a home in a world of the tax but would be able to access a home in a world without the tax. We think rich people will be able to get a home regardless. Taxes aren't really effective and they just sort of laugh at them. And we think that poor people, like really, really poor people, aren't looking to buy a home in the first place.",constructive1,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
429,429,395,"So these people on the middle, why is it good to give these people who are on that precipice of economic success and economic a house that they own? Four reasons. The first reason is financial stability. Think about all of the benefits to owning a home. There is one central location that you own the deed to that your rent and the amount you pay does not change, particularly once you own it yourself. The amount that you have, it increases your credit drastically. You're perceived as a much more legitimate [Boone 00:04:09] business owner. You have all these benefits to having a home. You have a community around you that's able to sort of support you, you live in a neighborhood, et cetera. The second thing is that it puts you on a sort of track for economic growth and opportunity because once you've bought a home, from there you can slowly move up once you've dealt with the problem of having to pay rent to everyone and dealing with that issue.",constructive1,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
430,430,396,"The third thing is that it gives you a legacy. So, a lot of people buy homes, and once they own them, they can pass them down to their children because they have the ability... I'll take you in a second... they have the ability to give ownership and transfer that ownership to someone else. That large scale intergenerational financial stability doesn't occur on their side of the house and they have no incentive to do it in the first place",constructive1,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
431,431,397,"The fourth reason is that the tax compounds mortgages. Let's say they're right and these mortgages devastate people, but let's say they're also right and people are irrationally pursuing a home. If that's the case, then you've just drastically increased the harm of a mortgage on their side of the house because it just destabilizes families because they [crosstalk 00:05:30] a tax on top of that.",constructive1,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
432,432,398,"The second argument is on the question of renters, which is a lot Two arguments here. The first one is that prices for renting drastically increased in their world. Their mechanism they gave you was something around the lines of, demand for rental increases, thus people will just provide more, it'll be cheaper.",constructive2,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
433,433,399,"They should think about the type of demand that increases. The type of demand that increases is inelastic. That means that the demand will stay the same regardless of what the price is. Because guess what? You need a place to live, right? So if that's the case, then people are willing to buy whatever prices are generally set. People have the incentive to set those prices higher because people are still willing to buy their insurance from this competitive market through the tax that government has placed. So in a world where they definitely need a home and they're only in one market, rent prices can increase. The second thing is that in a world of increased demand, they're able to sell significantly more of these things and the profit incentive increases. But the last thing that's very important is that you're taxing the people who are renting their homes out and renting their buildings out.",constructive2,ishanbhatt,round1,77.0,3
434,434,423,"So our first argument is that all tax policies should attempt to limit inequality. There are two reasons this is the case. First, the government has an obligation to prevent unrest, and we believe inequality leads to unrest.",constructive1,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
435,435,424,"When individuals in lower classes see the upper class lavishly spending on these things while they are suffering, while they are struggling to put food on the table, it causes them to be unrestful and possibly lash out with violence. The state wants to prevent that, and as such, they should take action to limit inequality to stop that from happening in the first place.",constructive1,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
436,436,425,"But secondly, tax structure in many cases controls inequality. For example, in the United States having a trickle down economic system because of a tax code that is favored for the rich directly resulted an increase in inequality over the long term. We see the tax structure is the key to both increasing inequality, but can also be the key to decreasing inequality.",constructive1,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
437,437,426,"We believe that this tax is a gateway to inequality. So why is that the case? This is our second argument. So firstly, an increase in wealth... There are three reasons why it increases wealth inequality. First, it increases wealth inequality between people. So taxes affect people on the margins most. I'll give you a clear example. If a wealthy person owns a mansion, they also probably can pay for whatever tax is going to be. They have a large amount of wealth, and they're not spending it all on the mansion. They're spending a small fraction of their total wealth on this mansion that's why they feel inclined to buy it. A person of middle income who owns a small house, they probably spent a vast more portion of their income, and a vast greater proportion of their savings trying to purchase this house, which means they have less money left over to pay that tax. So what we have left is a system where people who are middle income, who own small homes, these are the people who are unable to pay the tax while rich people who have mentioned are able to pay the tax.",constructive2,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
438,438,427,"But secondly, we believe that this increase in inequality also extends between individuals and corporations. So why is that the case? We believe that in the status quo, a large number of corporations are buying up homes where individuals will have done this. This looks like private equity corporations like Black Rock who have wealth exceeding trillions and trillions of dollars, some of which comes from owning these homes.",constructive2,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
439,439,428,"When these organizations enter a system in which there's a tax that prevents people from buying homes for personal reasons or at least discourages them from doing so, these firms who are purchasing homes for un-personal reasons have a better chance in the market and as such are going to purchase more and more homes.",constructive2,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
440,440,429,"So why is that so problematic? We believe that these corporations create rent monopoly. That is to say that if they own a large amount of homes in the United States or in any country in the world, they can raise rents on all their properties collectively, which in turn drives up rents for the entirety of the nation or entirety of the area. This is especially harmful for people who pay rent, not only through these corporations, but also they pay rent through another landlord that landlord is going to raise their rents because they see that other corporations can do it, and as a result everyone is paying more rent, which is horribly problematic.",constructive2,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
441,441,431,"But secondly, we believe it's also a phenomenon of intergenerational wealth transfer. That is to say if my parents... Or my parents do own our home, so they will probably sell it off when they are sadly about to pass away or they might just give it to me. That's better for me because now I have a head start on life and on finance because I have this huge amount of wealth that was created from this home. People who don't own the house as a result of his tax policy are not going to be able to get that benefit, and as a result there's more and more people not benefiting from this intergenerational wealth transfer.",constructive3,pmanisca,round1,77.0,3
442,442,559,Addressing my second question about why it's so important to have a home in the first place. I flagged this in my intro. I think this is the bulk of Emma's extension. It's really important material within this round. There are two sub points under why it's particularly important to own a home.,constructive1,kimevelyn37,round1,77.0,3
443,443,560,"One, on the idea of better living standards. We think that the inherent incentive of landlords is economically driven. They're not necessarily going to care about taking care of the little nitty gritty things, about making your home look pretty, or something like that. Because they ultimately ... the bottom line is that they want profits. We think that because of this, any individuals that are living in property owned by landlords are going to have lower quality standards.",constructive1,kimevelyn37,round1,77.0,3
444,444,561,"But secondly, we think that owning something just makes you more inclined to care about it. Like I care a lot more about taking the trash out of my own car versus when I'm renting it and I know I'm just going to return it later on. We think that because of this, there are simply going to be better quality housing when you have actual personal ownership of it.",constructive1,kimevelyn37,round1,77.0,3
445,445,563,"So going back to the point about permanence, we think that renting is always viewed as a temporary thing. There's risk of having to move elsewhere. It's not your property. And because of this, we think there's a lack of belonging that gets fostered within these individuals. Think about what suburban nice neighborhoods look like versus apartment complexes.",constructive1,kimevelyn37,round1,77.0,3
446,446,590,"And from here on we move to my point and tell you why we need houses, why owning houses isn't actually something that we see as smoking or as something that deserves punishment. First of all, I would just remind you what the leader of the opposition said, about how owning houses helps the poor. I will expand a bit on it. He basically talked about how when you live in the house that you own, you're not under the mercy of the landlord. YOu're not under the mercy of someone who can give you a notice, basically telling you that you have three months to find a new home with at a rate that you can pay. Landlords have proven throughout the years through many financial crises, that they will actually be predatory more than people... Oh sorry. They will be predatory and they will take advantage of the one's who are living in their apartments, their houses and etc.",constructive1,maltarif,round1,77.0,3
447,447,592,"Firstly, notice that the motion specifies that this is a punitive tax, right? This is a specific, this has a specific purpose of punishing the rich, and we think that this will likely be packaged by the government as being punishing the rich for what they're doing.",constructive1,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
448,448,593,"But second, home ownership is often something that's very sacred. It gives me security and it's what defines me as a family or a citizen of a country, right? It's oftentimes the very most longterm asset that you can get. So we think that the rich will react very adversely at the point in which the longest term asset is actually being passed 5% every single year. It's not very liquid. They're likely to react very, harshly to this reality.",constructive1,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
449,449,595,"But the second way this drives capital towards assets is that these assets are far, oftentimes far less transparent at the point in which you have less ability for the government to be prepared or adjust in terms of policy when the capital is driven down to islands in the Caribbean or Macau, right? We think that when capital becomes less transparent, the government has less flexibility on how to use that capital. But thirdly, you have some communities that are specifically reliant on foreign capital to stay sustainable.",constructive2,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
450,450,597,"Firstly, this is an incentive for the rich who have a commitment in these communities right now to invest and give to infrastructure to raise the value of their properties in these communities themselves.We think that this is beneficial because not only are the rich benefiting from their raise value of property, but all the other people, including people from the low socioeconomic class benefit from more convenient transportation system that gets there.                                                                                             ",constructive3,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
451,451,598,"The second way this brings a commitment in the community as whole is that there's a direct incentive to actually help out the poor in these communities at the point in which public housing is very, very scarce and we have enclaves, this looks bad in the community as a whole. This drives down the value of properties in that community as a whole.",constructive3,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
452,452,599,"The third thing I want to talk about and the third scenario in which the rich will react is the govt best case scenario in which they just pay the past themselves, this is the exact ideal scenario that the government wants. The problem then is the perception now is that the government is after that, that they are trying to punish them and disrespect. They're more likely to react in a hostile way to any further attempts to take away their incomes. Things like increasing public housing funding or things like welfare initiatives that make healthcare cheaper for the poor population. Recognize that the rich often have the most political capital in these communities and have the power to lobby governments both local and federal. The takeaway from this argument is that this punitive measure may be effective in the short term, but it takes away the ability to help the poor in the future, in an indefinite future where we can help the poor by having governments that can offer policies that are less intrusive to the rich, while also helping the poor and middle income populations",constructive4,andrewyun7,round1,77.0,3
453,453,640,"First, we believe that religious liberty is self-expression of one's religion that doesn't violate another person's rights. That is to say, the religious liberty and self expression can be wearing a hijab, but it is not being homophobic and then using the Christian values to justify that homophobia.",constructive1,pmanisca,round5,77.0,3
454,454,641,"Secondly, we believe that the mechanism in which this would work would be the following, if a state passes a law that the government believes is discriminatory, there would be funding cuts for that state. If that state has laws in place that are discriminatory in the status quo, when this policy would go into place, that funding will be cut until those policies are removed.",constructive2,pmanisca,round5,77.0,3
455,455,642,"All right, so three independent reasons why this is so important. The first is why religious liberty must be protected. Two reasons under this. First, religious minorities are often vulnerable. They often have distinguishing characteristics, such as religious garb that they wear in public. As a result of this, these individuals are often targets for violence because they are very easy to pick out of a crowd.",constructive3,pmanisca,round5,77.0,3
456,456,644,"First, these states or subnational governments rely on funding from the greater nation. Why is that the case? Firstly, these subnations don't have enough tax base to actually implement their big infrastructure projects. For example, Quebec. Quebec only has a few cities that it can draw money from, but the entirety of Canada has multiple ports and other cities that they can take taxes from. Often these discriminatory laws are implemented in places that have less income and less money associated with them. That is because religious bigotry and other types of discriminatory behavior are often seen in these areas that don't have a lot of interaction and who aren't liberalized, who aren't like the coastal elite places. As a result, we will see these laws more likely in North Dakota than in New York. These poorer States, like North Dakota, depend more on state funding from the federal government and as a result are uniquely positioned to suffer from enacting these laws.",constructive5,pmanisca,round5,77.0,3
457,457,646,"The first is that anti-religious hate movements will die down and simmer away. This is true because their worldview is no longer achievable. It is not possible to create a sub-state within a nation that has anti-religious laws if you're not going to get funding from you overall state. As a result, they have these people who advocate for these anti-religious movements no longer have a justifiable destination they can point their followers to. As a result, less and less people start to believe that they are credible and as a result, those movements tend to die out. We believe that's overall good because those people cause great harm to religious minorities.",constructive7,pmanisca,round5,77.0,3
458,458,655,"Secondly, we think that protest within those communities as well as courts as the added benefit that the stakeholders in the scenario are the ones bringing the case forward, right? If someone goes to court to try and challenge a law that they think is discriminatory, then it's an individual who's a part of that community who has a say so and how exactly we respond to these discriminatory laws in the best way possible. We don't think you've got that say so when it's just whoever the majority is in the federal government issuing down that decision from on high. Re-building my partners first point about how we think we're going to generally promote white majoritarian religions at the expense of the marginalized, right? So it's important to recognize that in Mexico, the president is always going to be Catholic as in the US right, the president is almost always going to be Christian.",constructive1,nmcdowe,round5,77.0,3
459,459,657,"In the States, one, we think this looks like inflame tensions now, right? So the people in there who were discriminatory against whatever religious group that we are talking about. We think that the cultural problem that's the underlying issue, just gets worse on their side of the house. Maybe you've got the law the way that the cultural problem manifested in, but now the people who wanted that law are even angrier, more likely to not hire those people, more likely to not allow them to express their religion in their place of work. We think the underlying cultural problem actually just gets worse.",constructive3,nmcdowe,round5,77.0,3

Now maybe the people who can't express their religion and have a job are also going to be denied social programs because they're at the bottom of the totem pole because we can't just assume that this policy is going to work out vividly at the board. In times of limited resources, we think this needs to end those societies, it's going to be the most marginalized groups, often the ones who's lost directly for thing too, that are going to be hurt by this lack of funding. Thank you.",constructive4,nmcdowe,round5,77.0,3
461,461,746,"So we assume that in government's role, I'm actually into this with my first thing, thank you for carrying me over. Well, what happens in governments world is that the richer and more economically developed countries in ACN try, are going to obviously try to get the currency, the value of the Asian currency higher. And what this does is it inherently hurts the export economies of the developing countries within ACN because they are no longer able to explore the same level that China will always be able to do in that region. And they are not able to export to Western countries the same way that they would if they had their own independent currency that was fluctuating and such. So what we see in your world is we see that these countries are getting taken advantage, not only in an inherent scale of what Singapore is going to want to do to raise the value of the currency, but also in that they do have different social structures that will inherently have different power levels within the ACN countries. It's just inherent to this debate. So, what my first theme is. The first theme is who gets the most net good on their Because Gov wants to claim that they do, which my partner tells me is completely wrong. So Gov tells you, on Front Gov, they tell you that this motion will foster communication and cooperation of ACN nations. What I am bringing to you is that the harms are created by raising the value of the currency. You're hurting the export economies of the poor nations within ACN. And that this is a harm that is going to develop on an economic stage that you cannot mitigate with your cooperation and claims that you haven't mechanized how other countries are going to invest in the ones that are hurt by this motion. So then Gov tells you that trade between these countries is important and tells you about, by raising the currency of the poor countries, there is a trade between these countries now, and then by having a similar currency is not going to expediate how much trade is done between these countries. Because right now trade is done between these countries and I don't think that he can say by having seen currency, it's going to foster that. I think it's actually going to hurt the countries that want to do the most trade with other nations that are within ACN.
And we think, tells you that it's making, inhibiting trade and making those currencies more expensive versus China who's always going to have a lower export currency and is always going to be able to export to the West, and to within Asia as well.
",constructive1,alexsteele32,round4,77.0,3
462,462,747,"So then our second point is, is this model possible under the status quo? We think that Gov hasn't proven to you that this model would work under the status quo to get the good that they want on their side of the house. What we tell you, Gov assumes that it's possible to apply this system that has been fine in the EU to ACN countries. So what does tell you? tells you that there are fundamental differences between these countries and there are motives that lead to more exploitation. There are fundamental differences within their economic structures that exist today, which are inherently contradictory to what you want on your side of the house. We don't think that this good that you have of economic cooperation is actually going to manifest the way that you assume that it has this entire round. comes up here and tells you that unified front is the most important thing to these countries. Why do we tell you that this is wrong? tells you that not only do the ACN countries not want a unified front when it comes to Western investment, they would prefer investment on a personal scale. There's no way that an ACN currency together is going to make investment from Western countries better. And not only, it's not going to happen on a universal scale. It's only going to come on a personal scale. And having them being able to target investment on a country by country basis is way more important to them than it would be if they were a collective.",constructive2,alexsteele32,round4,77.0,3
463,463,771,"The second thing here is that adulthood is a largely unilateral thing. That is to say if I am a child, I have multiple mechanisms that can check backward, like harms that have been perpetuated against me. That's the same my parents can step in whenever the state's not doing right, or that the state can step in when my parents aren't doing right. As an adult you don't have that same sort of like network, so you have to care about yourself.",constructive2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,77.0,3
464,464,772,"But thirdly, that adult decisions are more tangibly impactful for the people around them. So that is to say like if you invest in somebody's education, that then trickles down to their family, trickle down to their wife and you get larger scale change there, right?",constructive3,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,77.0,3
465,465,773,"So what is the substance of we're going to bring? The first idea here is that post-secondary education is a more affirmative period than it is in like the zero to five year old. Three reasons here, gave them perfectly. The first is socially, you learn how to function as a person in society. So that is to say we believe that it's important what happens in those first five years because we believe what's even more important is how you live the 20 years, the 80 years you have on this planet, so that is how you're going to weigh this round. We believe you learn how to function in society, and learn how to function for the people around you, but you have the access you had to go to post-secondary education to say, if I never learned how to, I don't know, how democracy works or how capitalism works, I'm just going to be screwed as an adult has to exist inside those systems. Secondly, we believe, economically, you learn the skills and the trades you need to be a producer in a system that only values people for their production. But thirdly, we believe you self-actualize, so how you feel about yourself can be checked back against the ills of your childhood. So that as I say, even if you had a terrible childhood, what you learn in your post-secondary system can check back against a terrible childhood you had.",constructive1,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,77.0,3
466,466,774,"So how do we solve back a lot of these inequalities? I think mischaracterizes the idea about inequality here. The problem now is that a lot of these early childhood periods do not have a regulatory body to check that for any inequality. So it's not the case that the state is doing a bad job. It's a case that the state's not doing a good enough job regulating the differences in early childhood development. Why is investing more money not going to solve this? For a couple of reasons. One, we believe the rich will always have more access to the levers of power to get better for their shoulder, no matter how much money you've probably spent in the system to equalize it. We believe the rich have better networks of access, no matter how much you give to lower income people. The families of the rich will always have the best nannies, the best healthcare services, the best, et cetera. But third, even when people get access to basic resources equally, there are still rich students get more of it because of the nature of capitalism, right? How do we solve back this educational inequality, these very foundational inequalities? The first is that the comparative is that there's no equality in a childcare system, no matter how much public funding goes towards it. But the second is that you get targeted spending across systems that are already meant to be more equal. So that's say you get more spending in the public education sector, you get more spending in trade schools, get more spending in... you get more spending in private health, private education systems. But the purpose of higher education is to solve back inequalities. I'll take it from that.",constructive2,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,77.0,3
467,467,776,"So why is secondary spending so much more needed? Remember that in the absence of motion, children still get taught and still get access to the basic skills you need to be alive. If that didn't happen, you would have massive childhood mortality. That is not the status quo, I'm not going to convince you otherwise. So why should your funding go to post-secondary education? I just told you the most important economic impact of this round is the student loan prices, but I leave the motion, but this one is going to go a little bit differently, right? We believe that the most important thing in this ground, then, is going to be what happens in the timeframe of a person's life when they progress out of their childhood years, and are no longer under the guise of their parents and they become individual agents. We believe leaving children high and dry in their post-secondary education is doing a massive injustice to people around us and the people of our society.",constructive1,ryanwilliamsdukedebate,round2,77.0,3
468,468,793,"So on the first idea, recognize that it's status quo, that parents in status quo, in minority communities and poor communities can not afford to take the time to raise the children in the manner in which they want to.
They cannot give their child the care that they need because they can't afford to spend that time because largely their time is taken with other things such as job responsibilities, such as other kinds of work, other kinds of things that they need to do for their family, which preclude them from the incredibly important task of child bearing. And note that these years tend to be the most important because it is in these years which you first experienced the world and you first come to understand the world around you and you're told who you are, who you should be, and who the rest of the world believes that you are. It is in these years that are most important to your sense of self identity first and foremost. More so than that, these are the years where all too often, children come to believe that they don't matter because they don't have the people around them who would possibly be telling them that they say for example, things like preschool. They're just another person in that class because their parents don't have the time to take care of them and they feel that they are dumped in there and they feel that they constantly, whether explicitly told, which is real tragedy but all too often, implicitly tough to believe that they don't quite matter in the same way but more than that, there's a cycle of self-validation once you fall behind because those are the years where you come to learn important skills such as how to read efficiently and quickly. How to write, how to engage in certain patterns of thoughts. When you fall behind in those developments, when you feel that you have difficulty reading in earlier grades, then you come to believe that you are bad at school and you have difficulty learning, and when you believe that you are not good at those things, there comes to be a cycle of self-validation where you believe you are not good at it, so you come to become worse at it. That does not happen in communities where children have more care applied to them because then, the narrative in poor communities is that a large amount of people are just not good enough and they are not made for this. They're not born for this, but in communities with the actual ability to afford that care, they are told that falling behind is not their faults and all they have to do is spend more time and have people spend more care upon them to actually catch up. While in poor communities, they are told that they cannot catch up because that's not who they are. We think that's a tragedy that can be fixed when we find things better and are able to provide better care. When we free parents to send their kids to better care or subsidized care such that parents can get better care.
I think that when we improve the ability for parents to actually care about the formative years and children get the messaging that they needs to be told and this creates a better platform for them to move forward? Note, I think the imperative that all politely it presents is that people are better able to access post secondary education. Note, first and foremost, that not everyone can access post secondary education. People who are able to access it are told that they're special and they have the ability to escape cause they're smart and they're talented.",constructive1,samuelwu,round2,77.0,3
469,469,794,"I think that's pretty fair first and foremost. Okay. So basically we told you that not everyone can access it and it's a limited subset of people who are able to access the benefits that are wants to provide in the first place. But more so than not, what happens is that it doesn't even help to subsidize it because people still have difficulty accessing it because the fundamental narrative that people believe in poor communities is that university is not for me, even school isn't for me. It's difficult to even change the narrative that the university is for me. People don't believe that they should be able to access that as benefits. Okay. Secondly, I want to talk about the narrative here and how the narrative changes when people are more able to access better care from an earlier age. So we would tell you that essentially, because there isn't the fundamental belief that school art are not for me, because there's no immediate benefit for them than there is for the people close to them. They failed to see the role models and that especially for women, it's difficult to believe that you belong in that system and it's especially important that people do believe that. I think that what happens is that when you give them better care earlier and when doing schoolwork, elementary school is less difficult because they have a better foundation, they're better able to believe that they do belong and they are better able to enjoy school because they have the basic prerequisite skills from an earlier age and they're able to progress further in that system. I think that's really important and that begins to change how people feel about it. As people progress further in that system and they are more able to believe as that system is for them and they're better able to believe that they do belong here because they have achieved more success earlier and further. Even if initially, the initial people this funding feels you actually address them and in later waves that people are able to progress further and further because they've themselves have progressed further in the system and they're able to manage that, to communicate that same value to their children and in future generations and they're able to actually build it and change the narrative that poor communities do not belong in school. We think that narrative is important to be changed.",constructive2,samuelwu,round2,77.0,3
470,470,24,"So two questions I'm going to largely answer in this speech then. Firstly, why is it still worse for every actor involved, the province or a state, it accepts this policy and cooperates. Secondly, what happens when funding is actually cut? Firstly, why is it still worse for all actors involved? Recognize that the popular will underlying this issue does not simply go away. It simply masks it at the point in which what is quantified as legislator is just not allowed anymore, it's just prohibited. We think that there are three main harms that you should care about. Firstly, it is worse for the religious population within that province or state because they now become a target of resentment within that province or state. Politicians have an incentive to shift the blame on these people for forcing their obedience to the federal government because they don't want to seem incompetent. They don't want to seem like their political agenda was compromised by the federal state.",constructive1,andrewyun7,round5,82.0,5
471,471,25,"But second, there's going to be lots of on the ground discrimination and protests that are locked, that can't be captured on the official level or the legislative level. Even people who are largely indifferent are now going to be moved to discriminate and hate these people in these countries [crosstalk 00:02:54] because now it is directly tied to who you are, who you identify with. Whether you are a Quebecer or not it is a very nationalistic issue and even people who weren't that tied to the religious aspect of this debate, of this controversy, now it becomes tied to who I am and what defines me as a Quebecer, which is you know, much more of an issue that is likely to divide the population and turn them against the religious minority in these provinces and States.",constructive2,andrewyun7,round5,82.0,5
472,472,27,"The third harm under this constructive argument is that you stop cooperation in all other respects other than these religious issues, things like healthcare provision or welfare provisions, which are extremely controversial issues already. Notice that Quebec, which is relatively a rich province in Canada holds up four provinces currently, like New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, and they're really grumpy about that already.",constructive4,andrewyun7,round5,82.0,5
473,473,28,"What happens when funding is actually cut? And we think that this isn't the realm of possibilities because it's highly politicized and a very nationalistic issue and the politicians in power risk looking weak to the federal government. We think that at the point in which they leave the country, that's to say Quebec or some other powerful state in the U.S. for example, leave that country and say ""we're not going to be part of your Federation anymore"", and we think that this is a very big harm, not a very likely one, but still in the realm of possibilities that exist in this debate, we think that this is terrible for the country as a whole, at the point in which your economic prosperity for every single citizen in your country is lured to an extent where you're stronger when you're together and you're weaker when you're separated. We think that this is a terrible future that side government puts in the realm of possibilities. We're very proud to oppose.",constructive5,andrewyun7,round5,82.0,5
474,474,45,"First, in terms of governance. So he's from is basically just that there's something implicit in the role of the federal government to do this and the constitution says it. So in terms of the constitution, we say we protect Liberty, but that begs the question of what we understand what's Liberty to look like. This is a simple place he pay. That is to say, different cultures understand what religious freedom actually is supposed to mean. That is to say, [Lacey K 00:00:02:39], when we use that backdrop of neutrality is what is more conducive to freedom of consciousness. Right? So the issue is it begs the question which is why there isn't a clear cut why the constitution doesn't actually solve.",constructive1,elainehe,round5,82.0,5
475,475,46,"Second of all though, we think that they implicitly can see that a lot of the DPM material, that there are differences due to culture based on their own argumentation. So I think that's another reason why we should defer to letting State government sort this out. And if very egregious cases bring it to federal case law, which as of us to bring is enduring precedent, that every single party can reach you.",constructive2,elainehe,round5,82.0,5
476,476,47,"Secondarily, the social contract understanding they give you, inherent to this idea, is the fact that good life is highly subjective, which is why we enter into the contract with the State in the first place. The symbol for some people, their life might be held. They can't proclaim their love for God from their rooftops every night. By contrast, there are some people for whom hearing that every night will make their life hell. The point is, therefore, the reason why we care about religious expression is because we presumably care about pluralism, right? Because in damage to this case is this argument that we should protect all religions, whether or not you're in the majority or minority.",constructive3,elainehe,round5,82.0,5
477,477,49,"Second of all though, I would talk about why the federal government is uniquely bad. I think Sandy gives you a lot of good arguments that aren't adequately dealt with and who told you that those individuals, some provinces, have ethic, have religious, have cultural factors that indicate that they have different understandings of what that should look like.",constructive5,elainehe,round5,82.0,5
478,478,50,"I think there's one feedback to this is basically just that perhaps some cases we used to hurt only minorities, so I think if you look at wording of the wall that was in the context, it literally tells you that it fans all religious symbols, not specific symbols. Right? So all symbols are included. It doesn't matter whether you're in the majority or minority. I think there might be arguments about imperfect implementation, but again their side also doesn't solve this because it's about the texts, the law, not the implementation. So they wouldn't solve that issue either. I didn't know. I think the why for their laws that health freedom will curtail it equally for all other people, at least in the eyes of the law is necessarily because there are different religions, there are different parts of the overall constituency, which is there's always an incentive to have across the board rule, instead of just specifically targeting minorities because that is incredibly easy to call out.",constructive6,elainehe,round5,82.0,5
479,479,51,"Second of all though, if that isn't true, if these legitimately are good faith attempts to limit religious intrusion into the public sphere and really don't need a strong arm then, case law said. The reason why case law is uniquely better is necessarily because it actually sets a procedural justice course that people are more likely to buy into, even if they don't buy the outcome. Which is to say, even if they don't like the decision that the court constitutes, they still believe that the correct channels of justice were filled, which is why in the long run, they're more likely to actually see to this and not just in vigilante justice, which really gets uniquely worse than State centric nonviolence necessarily because all that lines gets blamed on the State anyway for not cutting those minorities.",constructive7,elainehe,round5,82.0,5

When once they're bailed out, it's going to lead to dragging down of the entire of the currency of the association.

499,499,350,"Okay. that's it for refutation and now to get into our main constructive points. Firstly, why white men under the status quo are seen as objective. I think we see this in a lot of society. White men from higher socioeconomic status is seen as like relational identity and the relational experience. In movies, in books, in various media sources, particularly the communists, it's usually white men who are writing these sources and their identities are portrayed as the norm to which other identities are, you compare that to this standard that is a centric to to a lot of media outlets. You see this in politics as well. In Canada, in the United States legislative bodies are overwhelmingly filled with white men, the same educational and same socioeconomic status. We see their identity in the center as over-represented. So we believe that this is this narrative of them being objective just because it's seen as this overall standard. Moving into our second point of fundamentally why this is problematic. We see their experience portrayed an objective when nobody is objective, everybody is a sum of their life experiences, the interactions they have with other people in their lives, the events that they experience, their educational experiences. Everyone lived experiences and these things inform the kinds of political priorities people will pursue once they get into politics. This influences the options they see as viable when addressing certain political issues.

This is a luxury that white men already have. What our side of the house does is open this up to multiple different demographics to everybody in society. This means that when activists who are lobbying for police reform, women who had children who have been brutalized by the police, people from racialized communities, when they are angry about this issue, they are seen as credible and not as irrational and angry and their opinions aren't just swept aside because of their emotional reaction to this. So it leads to a higher valuation of their experiences, which leads to better policy reform and more new wants to be, Cheryl People vote for people they think speak for their experiences. When the working class in America voted for Trump, who talked about America losing versus Hillary who would've had good policy for the working class but was seen as elitist. How does this get better at your side of the house? Well, we think that Trump got away with emotional appeals because he was seen as objective because of his white privilege and because of his high socioeconomic status he was able to talk with his issues and give out this illusion of I am looking at this subjectively from an expert opinion because of that privilege. That's not something that all people from marginalized communities get to use as a political tool. So yes. That's what we see on RSI. I said that I was on their side of the world. We have a world where people have lived, experiences are ignored while people who are usually the source of the problem that they are advocating for are seen as more legitimate because they're able to talk about these issues this passionately. If we go back to my example of racialized communities who have been brutalized by the police, they are angry about this issue because they haven't been deeply hurt by this issue. Rich, white politicians who are not hurt by this issue, are able to talk about these issues dis passionately because they don't have the same incentive to care. Therefore, under the status quo, where objectivity is the standard. Their opinion is valued much higher when it shouldn't be, and this just does not motivate political change work where it should be. ",constructive3,nvard040,round3,75.0,2
502,502,362,"That's why we think it's more likely that anger is going to be co-opted by elites, rather than it's going to be used by activists, which is a reason why we should prefer objective approaches to policy, such as data that thousands of people have experienced these things rather than, ""I am angry because I have experienced this."" We think that the methodologic difference between those two things means that it's more likely that people with agenda setting power will take advantage of emotions and use it as a means to discredit people. The second reason why we think that it's more likely that elites will co-opt anger than activists will use anger to mobilize it is that there's a bunch of examples out there and ones that we have given you about how in the past, subjectivity has been used to discredit valid and good positions. For example, climate change deniers look at the same facts as everyone else, but then manipulate those facts into the interest of the elite, which are oil corporations with large money and a lot of agenda setting power. We think that's an example of how subjectivity is used to create terrible political and it's been mobilized by elites. The flip side of this is that even when there's a group of people who are super angry but don't have any direction to direct their anger in. People like Trump or populists are able to take that anger and direct it towards a terrible cause like the immigrants from this country. The last example that I'll bring up is how British colonizers in India created the modern day cast system by turning people against each other in order to create conflict between classes. This is an example of how subjective experiences were mobilized to benefit the interest of the elite, which is why we think that objectivity is better. Now, the last comparative between the probability of elites co-opting anger and the probability of activists using anger to mobilize is this that, if it's the case that elites are going to discredit activist movements, we think that it's better for activist movements to change their strategies, rather than just to feed into what elites want them to do.",constructive2,meganwu,round3,75.0,2

I went to preschool from a local church that my parents weren't even a part of it because the society knew the importance of having children learn skills.

We think that this commercial use was never included in the model, and crucially, I think it's obviously outside of the scope of the debate. What this does, is it moves things to more of a renter's market, which we think is a little bit problematic, particularly when my house is liquidating.

If you want to do things like, I don't know, prevent people from going in, buying houses and just have them sit there, as a sieve for wealth, you can tax vacant homes. Who would have thought of that? Instead of just taxing home ownership for personal reasons, generally. We think therefore, that that's non-exclusive, and that even if we can see literally everything and all of our cases wrong, we've accomplished literally every single one of their benefits by just putting a tax on vacant homes like the Vancouver City Council proposed to do, as massive Chinese investment came, and it ruined neighborhoods with empty homes. We think that's not an benefit to this other house. We don't see pledge beneficial.

People less likely to own many houses ... people are less likely to own many houses in the world of government's motto because as we tax more houses, people no longer see it as necessary to buy four or five houses, and rich people likely buy fewer houses. It also shifts markets to first time buyers. Instead of markets being over-saturated by buyers going for their second, third, fourth, and fifth house, first time buyer is going to have a greater access to markets, and be able to get housings at a more affordable rate because demand will likely go down from all these people who are no longer buying multiple houses.",constructive1,arjunp,round1,75.0,2

522,522,555,"So moving on to the argument, why do we believe people on the lower financial spectrum are more likely to be disenfranchised? First understand under the middle class, from the very beginning, we already characterized to how oftentimes the only tangible assets of these people own are property. Oftentimes liquid cash is simply harder to attain because oftentimes liquid cash is going away in a lot of daily expenditures and things like that. So the conclusion is at the end of the day, under their world, it's often difficult for these individuals to pay the tax to begin with. Second, we believe if this motion is passed, it will create an even more imbalance within home ownership",constructive1,jumzthewarrior,round1,75.0,2
523,523,556,"We believe first, it removes the incentive for a large group of people to ever go up the social ladder and buy property to begin with. Because oftentimes the fact that punitive taxing is extremely scary for a lot of families and a lot of individuals, meaning a lot of families who are within the middle class or even lower middle class, so a spectrum, know they are going to be unable to pay these taxes to begin with. So the incentive structure for them to ever buy property and ever have financial stability through that property is lost and we believe that's extremely dangerous for these families,",constructive1,jumzthewarrior,round1,75.0,2
524,524,557,"Third, why believe, why do we believe that it's extremely harder for renters as well? Because understand, as I've already told you, that oftentimes the cost of the taxes, the taxation costs trickles down to renters, but oftentimes it was also important to recognize that individuals or families who still want to buy property are now going to have to choose mortgages, meaning that this cost is going to. We already know how the cycle of mortgages is often very dangerous for individuals because they get caught up in a cycle of loans and they're unable to pay back, meaning that even if they go for a loan, they're probably at a risk of losing their property at the end of the day.",constructive1,jumzthewarrior,round1,75.0,2
525,525,558,"Third, what happens when an imbalance occurs within property distribution, which we already proved, which I already proven myself, in the first half of my argument. We believe at the end of the day, richer individuals will still own property regardless. And why is that the case? One, they can simply afford to buy, so. Second, they can often afford to pay the taxes as well. So at the end of the day, the harms of do trickle down to the individuals who are at the lower end of the spectrum. But if this imbalance occurs while the individuals are now going to have complete control of prices of housing, this is extremely detrimental because then they're only going to rent out their housing at prices that is palatable to either richer individuals or upper middle class individuals, meaning people in the middle and people in the lower spectrum are now unable to one buy these property, this property as well. B, rent it out as well. So the pricing of housing in itself is more likely to go up under their world when they create a system of taxation for these groups as well.",constructive2,jumzthewarrior,round1,75.0,2

First of all, recognize that even if they are not in that recipient of government money, right? Even if these provinces and States are in that recipient, which we think they generally are, because that's generally how federal taxation works. They are so intertwined with their programs and their systems with federal government funding, that ultimately if you were to take that away, there would be massive economic harm to that particular state. Right? This looks like in Quebec, them relying on government money for their healthcare in large part as well as using provincial funds. Right? It looks like having education funding or federal rents come down a Right? Same thing is true with various states. They need federal money for like things like Medicare expansion if they have that.

All that you need to know is that the government in power to hates your guts in order for you to feel alienated. We think that when they stop trying to implement these policies and they focus on other ones instead, because it's too, sort of like politically costly, you think you're going to feel more welcome in that society.

We think we decrease the number of hate crimes because people are less cognizant of their hatred for people wearing burka's, because recognize there's nothing intrinsically offensive about wearing a burka.

I think you have to acknowledge what we're talking about in this debate, it's not any employee that's in these provinces or states. This is only federal employees. These are people that are working at the state or governmental level that are doing this. So we're saying, when you do this now, you're losing huge programs like teachers for public schools that are already a huge issue, police to actually go in. It's already hard enough to get police in a lot of areas, especially very crime-ly areas, and now you don't have better resources for police to do a better job in these areas.

We think the problem then, is that religious minorities become the scapegoat to a lot of people being really upset that they've now lost their federal funding.

532,532,759,"Now our first argument can be described and supported through a variety of different mechanisms and impacts, and it, broadly speaking, is the following. Including subjective experiences and feelings within a political debate is, we regret, not being excluded simply because it is a more holistic and consequently more impactful on the policy side way of approaching political debate. This can be seen because if you look at the difference in value of qualitative and quantitative reasoning, qualitative and quantitative data or approaches to reasoning. So the mechanism is as follows. If feelings or subjective experiences are acquired, then you gather more rich and thick descriptions of a phenomenon that consequently better inform you to make policy. There are a variety of different problems and solutions that were derived in the world and that have come out of political debates that simply could not be informed by objective fact. If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world. A very good example of this is a study that was conducted and had qualitative methods that were used, focused on subjective feelings, about what the impact for Asian American immigrants was coming to United States. And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics? And you cannot answer that question by looking at objective fact. That is way too narrow and reductionist. So instead, what was done and which effectively proves the argument that we're trying to make today is, instead what happened was interviews were conducted, shared experiences were shared, and from that, a whole rich, thick set of data came out, and consequently informed in how to better, in an informing way, of us understanding the true impact of, for example, segregation and assimilation on Asian American immigrants. Now this is a very broad example and to connect it back to the resolution, I want to talk about its impact. So the impact of this greater idea of subjective experiences and feelings provide a whole more holistic understanding of policy, and therefore are important in a debate and that's why we regret it. The impact can be seen simply, for one, by looking at the comparative. So if these feelings and subjective feelings were excluded from this debate, then we simply would not have insight into feelings of, specifically in this case and which can be seen on a more broad scale, marginalized communities.",constructive1,zoejohnson,round3,75.0,2

I've already gone into intergenerational benefit that we're getting here, where on our side we're helping people now so that they can then in turn have better lives and they won't be stuck in the same...

And we think that the burdens that exist on parents that are then compounded when we throw in taking care of children without a great deal of early childhood care assistance, means that there is a significant trade off here. It is trading off between assisting people who are already practically adults, we would say, in going into post-secondary education, at that time when they are adults, versus the trade out of supporting people who are adults, but at that time may have to take care of their own parents, have to work their own jobs, and potentially work on career advancement if they are trying to make a better life for their own children, and have to, on top of that, then take care of their own children.",constructive1,srao3,round2,75.0,2
535,535,796,"We think that with regards to the relationship between whether or not having significant funding for post-secondary education as a prerequisite for doing early childcare, we would say, first of all, that we don't scrap post-secondary education funding. We don't think that it's the case, that in this world, now, there are no trade schools. Or if there are trade schools, they are solely private and nobody can afford them. Or that there are no community colleges. We simply have changed the funding priority. We also think that it's the case that employable people sort of fill these gaps in employment that they say don't exist, in order to fulfill the needs of early childhood care because of the lack of post-secondary education. It's precisely why that in order to have these benefits, we need the greater funding, in order to incentivize these people. Rather to flee the country, rather to go somewhere else, but rather to stay because there's a financial incentive to be a early childhood care physician, or psychologist, et cetera, or an educator in an existing country due to the priority given to this by the government in terms of funding. We think that creating this kind of financial incentive means that we solve for harm of lack of employability in these positions, that might be caused by an absence of post-secondary education, but also that post-secondary education at least the absence is mitigated by the fact that we aren't scrapping this entirely, and then just pressing to a sufficient degree that we can make up for in the long run the absence of having tons of early childhood care psychologist such that this becomes a lower cost in the longterm and we are able perhaps to shift priority later or to maintaining this priority but do so even greater effectiveness, creating even less educational inequity in the longterm because of the educational inequities that, as my partner tells us, start very early in childhood and therefore need to be resolved at that time.",constructive2,srao3,round2,75.0,2
536,536,797,"We also think that with regards to this sort of cycle of not pursuing post-secondary education whatsoever, the only side government actually solves for this In order to break the cycle of not going to college, which, side- off, the student tells us is predicated on this idea, ""if my parents had not gone to college, I may not have gone to college."" We think that it's the case that parents who are overburdened by childcare are unable to create the kind of conditions necessary to allow their own children to go to college, to create an environment for their children to attend school because it's more likely for it to be the case that due to subsidize the childcare costs that they have to incur, that may have forced them to work less, to force, in many countries, mothers to remain in the home rather than to continue working to perhaps make it such that their children have to, rather than pursuing post secondary education, take care of their own parents starting from a much younger age because their own parents were unable to advance their own careers or just save up enough money to allow them to be secure so that their children could pursue their own lives which we get by alleviating the burden of parents when they need to take care of their children at a young age.

What this actually looks like is giving Singapore an incredible opportunity to start doing things like predatory lending, like holding Malaysia accountable when they've paid for their roads or trains or whatever it is. Being that Singapore is really likely to use this as a bargaining chip for the rest of time, and this is probably really bad for those under developing countries.

Take a case like me, for example. My father bought his house, I live in Toronto, which is currently experiencing a housing bubble similar to that of Vancouver. My father inherited his house from his grandparents and the only way that I see myself, an earth's degree major, able to live and effectively contribute to the economy in the future is through the revenue and is through the capital that I obtained through inheritance. Do I deserve that? Not necessarily, but that is not part of this discussion.

Remortgaging increases equality through the following mechanism. You can remortgage your house through what you invest in it to invest or simply to get you out of tricky situations. For example, if you're caught up in court, what you can do is remortgage your house to help pay for very expensive law bills, which also disproportionately affect the middle class.

They talk about renters for example, needing the access to other amenities and better conditions for people who rent.

551,551,353,"We think a lot of the times the minorities feel excluded, is the most active voices are not just minorities that are now able to talk about certain problems. Rumor will tell you that minorities are these full often society and are systematically excluded and discriminated against. So when you start using hate speech, mainstream politicians are not going to be automatically. Let me talk about minority narratives. Let me talk about these ideas that they see themselves as fringe. What happens is those narratives just get more excluded because the subjectivity that people are most strong about is going to be this idea of the language that is more racist, more homophobic, and even if you do find their point, that there happens to be a greater impact of minority voices, the amount of hate speech that it incites from the other side of the amount of racism or homophobia or sexism, but then incite. Is it going to be more helpful? You're going to get politicians that are more likely to be populous, more likely to be Democrats that will lead from backslides of the democracy into authoritarianism. We tell you this is especially dangerous in countries where you don't have the same sort of free speech for hecklers and stuff. The language used mattered. You are able to talk and have discussions about what minorities think is important through policy decisions, not just focus on these pleased emotionality. Also, remember that when people focus on that subjective experience, they only focus on their subjective experience and not the subjective experience of others. They will be so stuck in the echo chambers that they won't even be able to see the other side. So let's talk about conservatives. Oftentimes we think they're angry and they miss the nuance of policy because they're stuck in their echo chamber as well. We also think moderates feel excluded when only talking about exclusion. We all know that there is a silent majority that doesn't get their voice heard because they feel that they don't fit into either of the echo chambers. So we get more sustained coalitions on our side of the house. Think about an issue like healthcare. A lot of the nuance about healthcare is not focused on the values of either side. From both sides, yell at each other, they bisque each other and go to any nuance of the situation.",constructive1,jbotkin1,round3,74.0,1

These people can overcome issues when they talk about objective issues themselves, rather than emotional appeals that exclude certain narratives and make people angry or when people are less angry, able to focus on policy, we think you are able to get better policy, more progressive policy passes. This is really important because it helps everyone in society. So for instance, if you have a country like the US passing healthcare reform, you don't get that if you have Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi yelling at each other. But you do get that if you have politicians that are able to focus on the new wants and represent the views of the silent majority by focusing on this idea of policy. Now let's also talk about the nature of political conversation. We think when people are able to see across the differences, they're able to find similarities and this results in the right turnout in the ballot box. We think you get issue oriented voters, right? You get money in political campaigns being spent on education of people about the issues rather than people fighting about political feuds themselves. We think this makes the voters more educated and the you get is not just like right-wing populace who have gotten really mad about something that was racist on Fox news for instance, or something that was said on a political radio, to be somewhere in the developing world and instead you get more issues of never working against the sensationality.",constructive2,jbotkin1,round3,74.0,1
553,553,359,"Okay. So, what is my partner referring to? First of all, that with, with objective debates, we get more productive debates, right? Because in these debates we're, we're, we're talking about the facts and the impacts of the facts, right? We're talking about the actual facts at hand, the objective facts at hand and we're not, and, and so you can actually talk about the impacts you get from that, instead of either debating the facts themselves, which we get on, on the subjective side, because people are, are approaching this from all these different subjective angles, so they start debating the facts themselves, such as with climate change. So many people are trying to debate whether or not that's actually a thing, when it truly is. When we're talking about it objectively, we can actually talk about what the impacts of a certain policy on climate change will actually have on the people, and then we get to have people actually decide based on those facts and the analysis of the impact of the facts, what, how they will actually be affected, right? So, instead of arguing about the facts, we're arguing about what, what policy we should do to address the actual objective problem and what outcomes we have from any policy, policy that we have with subject... with subjectivity, you end up at, you ended up attacking the other person's rhetoric, right? You end up, and you end up having this sort of, this sort of polarized rhetoric, you end up attacking them in that sort of way instead of actually talking, debating the actual facts and debating the actual impacts of those facts, because you're coming from the subjective viewpoint and you can't actually look at what the actual objective part of it is, because everyone is looking at it from, from a purely, from a completely emotional standpoint and they're not able to actually see what, what the, what the actual thing is. So, you end up with the, with these rhetoric attacks and these ad hominine attacks, like, like we've seen in so many of the presidential debates in the United States over the past five years and you see that happening in places like on The Time as well, where, where political candidates are attacking each other and sort of actually attacking each other's, each other's policy or their, their ideas for policy, right? We, we, on our side, we get people having conversations about the impacts that mattered to them instead of just how the facts pertain to them, right? So, so let's look at an example of this opposition product. The, the thing with police brutality and the Black Lives Matter Movement. Well, what do we get with subjectivity? What we get when we're having a conversation on Black Lives Matter, what subjectivity is, you get a large group of people saying that, ""Oh these, the group of people that's All Lives Matter..."", they say that the, the, the BLM people are either too reactionary or they're, or they're saying stuff like, like, ""Oh, they're radical or, or, or, they don't want the best for society. When you look at what's actually going on objectively, when you, when you see what, what's actually happening to these people and you have, you have the people in these political debates talking about what is actually happening within those communities and within the wider community, you can get people start to see the actual harms of, of, of, maybe not having this Black Lives Matter Movement or the harms that these people are actually advocating against. Instead of, when you're, when, when it's subjective, you get all these people talk, just talking about how, ""Oh that problem, that doesn't even matter to me, because I'm not black, so I don't care about it and in my own personal subjective narrative, it does not matter to me."" Right? But when you're talking about an objective, you get to see the actual harms to all of society that, that seems sorts of things have.",constructive1,nmasoom,round3,74.0,1
554,554,360,"What does, the second thing my partner brings me is that objective debate reduces the polarity that we see in political systems all over the world increasing today, right? Everyone, when you, when you take a debate from a more objective standpoint, you end up looking at and analyzing the same facts, right? Everyone is looking at the same facts and the same objective reality and then, from that standpoint, while you may be coming from... while people themselves, may be coming from different subjective experiences, we can all come to more similar conclusions when we're all looking at the same facts instead of debating the facts themselves. No, thank you. So, you get to, so what people do instead of being taught, instead of being told what to think by these polit... by these subjective politicians, instead they're told the facts and they're told the impacts of the policies that these politicians want to put into place, and from that they get to make their, their, they, they get to make their, they get to make their own analysis of, of what actually happens. Like with the whole abortion debate, instead of just having a reactionary subjective response to people and being like, ""Oh, they want to, they want to murder children"", instead you get to see what the benefits of like funding a planned Parenthood in a community actually has and how maybe that doesn't negatively affect you so much that you shouldn't allow other people to have abortions or things like that.

That's to say, we don't want rights in our world in which either they're one, inequitable, that means that you have more rights than other people simply because you've been able to like make it further in society. But secondly that you shouldn't have these rights if you're using these to actively harm others.

Two things, firstly is that these people, instead of buying houses, which then they're going to be taxed exponentially on, they can spend their money in other areas of business. For example, they can donate to things like charity or they can donate to other businesses that they run in order to make more profits. We think that switching their focus from simply real estate investment into other forms of business would be better because at least they don't result in the practical harms of homelessness that we see in today's society.

When we talk a lot about this whole idea that specific minorities, for example, trans people and people of color may often feel as if they've been oppressed by different religious groups.

587,587,717,"So, the entire government bench hangs their hat on this idea that objectivity is unique and beneficial for people who are already in power. We think only opportunity, a market of. We're going to show you why. So, look at the people which are in power at the moment. Look at Trump with the idea of making America great again, look at the xenophobia that these powerful political movements generally don't end by the conservative white male majorities the government talks about, these are motivated by emotions. Make America Great Again is a nostalgic, nationalist slogan. Brexit was motivated by xenophobia and fear of globalization. These are narratives of emotion, whereas if you look at the movements that run against it, if you look at the Romaine campaign, if you look at those for instance who oppose the trade war against trial the reason they oppose these things, and the key effectiveness to their advocacy is the fact that, the trade war is costing American's billions and billions of dollars and leaving the EU will cost Britain billions and billions of dollars they just have very tangible effects for very real people. The fact is, we see that people who are in these power majorities have this ability to use power, to use this sort of thing very harmfully. Recognize that now it's about the legal discourse do coexist. We've been always going, again, by the subjective and objective commentary, but we can never debunk this objective because we can weigh it, we can put two identical experiences against each other and both of these emotions exist. Even if you disagree with one of them, both of them exist. Both of these experiences happened, but, and people thought this. But in a way one objective truth against an existing truth that is not real and that someone is just standing up to try and fight the legal debate. We can have, we have fact checking. We can do research. We can see who is actually right. And so it allows claim... it allows things like the trade war to be debunked and say this is wrong, this is a bad policy. It allows the Romaine campaign to say ""This is good."" And this is what is changing public opinion in both the US and in Britain to now oppose both of these things. To be considered in those movements, exceeded in the beginning over time, objectivity is actually winning out in this battle against the power majorities. And, we also, at one point, on our ballots, in a time closing government, this idea about empathizing with xenophobes. I think it's a really misleading argument, because if we empathize with xenophobes, what you feel is okay, what you feel is right, what they feel is a hatred and fear of outsiders. That is not okay, that is not all right. What, instead, we want to do is show them the objective facts and the reasons behind why they shouldn't be afraid of outsiders, because in fact, immigration is really beneficial. Diversity is really beneficial, its really helpful for the economy. These are the ways that we show people why their views are not going to help them, and why we should actually make a much better society by trading discourse. Subjective experiences, I'm also going to, it must've been weaponized by power majorities, because subjective and the emotion, always plays better in the media. Power majorities have much, much better access to media apparatus due to their status in society. So they're always going to be able to weaponize these narratives in a better way. Power minorities can use the simple power of truth to equalize the scales, because smaller NGO's and groups like Politifact can actually check those narratives, can show that... Not everyone's going to buy into this stuff, and everyone's going to see that over time the march of truth is and always check back against these narratives that power majorities propagate through the media.",constructive1,alexnielsen,round3,74.0,1

Truly this narrative, without that, we would never have gotten to where we are today. They tell you Abolitionism. The question is why'd the Abolitionists start carrying and start making pamphlets? Even if you believe the turning point for Abolitionism was this emotional response, the only reason this emotional response was ever activated in the first place was because of a change in the human minds of the intelligence  in general, by this entire revolution of believing in political dignity.

They also fail to acknowledge the fact that their opinions and their perspectives are inherently shaped by where they live, their socioeconomic class, where like their gender, their race, sexuality, et cetera. I think that when this happens, you can try to be objective and say, ""Oh no, this isn't necessarily the case."" I see that people have different experiences than me, but I think that when they talk about being objective, they're inherently biased because of their perspective and they tend to lose sight of the other experiences that are available, especially emotional experiences from groups that aren't necessarily there. I think that a good example of this is the abortion debate. I think that both sides both have their only objective. They both believe their sides are the objective truth, and they tend to ignore that the other side's issues as being like more emotional or less based on fact. Not right now. But they're... They fail to acknowledge the ways in which these can be treated.

The data is collected, and while some data might be skewed as a aggregate as a whole, data is way more objective than subjective experiences. Which goes a little bit into what opening government says. While you can use subjective experiences to further a goal, you could also use it that would work against you. I mean in the sense of, the narrative of the American dream does not work for most people, but does work for some people. 
So if they're arguing from a subjective point of view, ""Oh, like, I started from nothing. I worked my way up. The American dream can work."" Then you're arguing for this, which is clearly against the structural gravity that we do know factually shown are put in place. So this other tube, we can go either way. It can work for the good of the country, as in actually acknowledging the structural areas, or it could be the other way and deny the good of the country and deny these structural barriers exist. We say with objectivity, you have a much more chance of acknowledging the structural barriers. So identity politics would become about branding. Elections would be based on this. Political discourse would become focused on experiences rather than policy. This will happen because politicians would be more concerned about building up their ethos over their policy and tearing down other ethos. Elections would become about who was a better candidate. Not in the sense of, are they going to do better things for our country, but who we'd rather want running us. And then their ethos would be elected. So politicians won't be seen as their idea, they'd just be seen as their sum of their experiences. Which is problematic in multiple ways. One, because politicians need to represent people who have different experiences than just their own. There are very few people who've lived the exact same lives as the politician has currently lived. So they need to be able to represent people beyond the scope of themself, have either had slightly different experiences or largely different experiences.Especially in terms of senators and the president, who have to represent large groups of people rather than just one rural community. And we think this is inherently bad. Because if politicians believe voters could only ... If voters believe that politicians can only support those who have identical experiences with them, this will decrease their faith in the government structure as a whole. They will have less faith that government can actually represent them if they don't see a candidate who is directly in line with their experiences, their emotions, their ideals.And if they have less focus, if they don't see candidates that can represent them and they see that, there'll be less voter turnout, there'll be just overall a falling down of government and ...

You will get someone who's very passionate in office, but that still leaves the problem still exists. I would rather have someone who might have slightly less passion, but have an actual way to fix the problem. Because we can agree on both sides of the house, and in all politicians that there are problems that exist in the world. And we would rather have someone in the office that can fix the problems, rather than just talk around the problem and relate to the problem. We think the goal of this should be have put people into office who could actually fix the problems.

If you value mechanization you can see, okay, they proposed we do this, this and this, which will result in fixing this structural barrier. They just talk about this a lot and don't actually propose how we fix it. So by the end of their term in office, this structural barrier will still exist. Therefore, we should have ...

It's necessary to have this stable source of housing in order to seek employment, in order to be invested in your community. When you're renting, you're always subject to eviction notices from the landlords who are always pickled, who are always going to be increasing the rent as market rates change.

As a result of that, a, your life has improved but b, you also get a higher quality of life and you also are more likely to provide services to your community. And when everyone is more likely to provide services to the community, then people across everyone within that community obviously benefits.",constructive2,jamesashwell,round1,81.0,5

624,624,356,"And we've talked about this whole idea of how you're able to use this whole idea of objectivity as a bludgeon to hurt the most vulnerable people in society. When we're looking at minorities especially, as my partner brought up, there's this whole often-quoted, right-wing idea of 13 percent where they say 13 percent of minorities commit 50 percent of all crimes. And they use that to justify a lot of different, very harmful, policies to others. And they're using that under a very objective standpoint that yeah, this does happen. It does. They're able to use numbers and hard facts, which, under this current narrative, people way higher than they do exploit lived experiences and emotions in order to justify very harmful policies towards minorities like Chris, which, under Bloomberg in New York, he said that, ""Oh it's reduced dramatically, so it's a good idea,"" even though it's actually has led to more victimization of people who may be innocent of minorities. And you can see that what's happening is: focusing solely on data, or even just placing a higher emphasis on data and these objective numbers and percentages and facts, are able to be used as a guise by bad actors in order to actually harm those who are most vulnerable in a society. And what we're saying is that in total, what's going to happen is that this is going to negatively impact policy-making as a whole not only for minorities, but for everyone because of this apparent subjectivity of a human experience. So what happens is that objective policies are not really objective whatsoever because everyone has their own situations and affiliations and biases. And what happens is people are able to hide these biases under this horrible objective ideology and be able to interpret the data that they either collected or are given in order to fit their own world view.",constructive1,ksbrown,round3,71.0,0
625,625,358,"Well, we don't think... We believe that other than, well... We believe that the current narrative promotes other ways and has this, as I said, as one of its key ideas under this idea of objectivity. When you know the status quo weighs objectivity and political debate over emotions and lived experiences, it's able to create this idea that, ""Oh, I might feel bad for individuals and I might be able to empathize with them, but the numbers don't lie. So I just have to follow up this more objective idea that might not even be objective at all is instead being interpreted by the bad actors, like big think-tanks and such in order to fit their own worldview.. And when you talk, then opposition for yourself. This whole idea of fun, informed citizens being manipulated by emotions. I believe that what happens instead is that uninformed citizens can be a lot easier manipulated by data because under this current model, data is seen as a high standard. So when you have different news sources pushing, there own interpretations of data that might not be correct, there might be bias as data can often be, data is not, in fact, unbiased. There's different ways to study. Uninformed citizens are going to end up being informed by that and that, moreover, how their neighbors are actually living their lives. They're not going to be able to empathize with their neighbors because they're the numbers don't lie. Instead they're not able to actually hold... be able to be held accountable. And it's because you got to say that the numbers are preeminent and that actual, lived experiences of people are ignored.

Small companies are going to leave and then big property big companies are going to come up and snatch up all this property that is now apparently free and is going and the state doesn't automatically own this property. Large companies are going to own it and then corner the market on renting and that all of these harms are just going to get passed onto the renter and all the taxes that they are now paying are just going to get passed onto the rent of the people who are now renting these properties.,constructive1,alexsteele32,round1,71.0,0

Which once you pay rent money, it's gone but if you're paying money towards mortgage, eventually you have a property that you own and is important capital. And we think that that model under the status quo is more important than any model that the gov gives you [crosstalk 00:04:48] at any... No thanks.

Why would you cut like the whole state's government when you're, why would you cut the whole funding which impacts everyone, which the majority of people as governments has already said are not religiously oppressive. Why harm them? We are wanting specifically to target those who are oppressive so that they can reform and that's where we do that. No, and then so now we're going to move on in the last minute and a half to are like, just to recap our contentions, right? So we already talked about the first one. I'm kind of beating it over the head because it's important, which is that you don't want to cut minority for a cut funding for minority groups. Like what's the impact of this? Like minority groups, like they're already being oppressed. What happens if you cut their funding?",constructive2,mswan,round5,71.0,0
630,630,649,"They can lose government jobs. Then they have to tap into their savings. They lose savings. They can have a later retirement because they don't have any money left. Right. Our second one is that we cut politicians who are responsible, cut off politicians and we do that by like removing funding from their constituents, which leads to either their reform or their the third contention. And this is something that we only get in the closing opposition. It's about proactive versus reactive. Right. And this was not at all, we didn't hear any engagement from closing government on this. They did not review this, which, so it probably would stand, which Anish brought up is saying that like, okay, all of these are reactive methods, right? Like what happens when there's religious discrimination in order to make this not happen? You know, like it happens in some areas. But in order for a state to be most impactful, we must focus on proactive things to make sure it doesn't even happen in the future.",constructive3,mswan,round5,71.0,0
631,631,766,"To the first contention is brain development. These formative years, zero to five scientifically show that this is when children gain literacy and awareness, both socially and academically. Those are both very important. We will get into those how they differ and how they're both necessary. Studies actually show a lot of universities have researched that these years are way more formative and lead to greater success, when kids have an education that's stronger in years zero to five than later. A lot of people have done studies about it actually. You can look it up. Why is this? Why, why? I could just say for the years that studies are showing, but why don't aren't they showing, because they develop social groups. Imagine you're an only child and your parents. You're an only child so you don't have other kids to be around and play with. You're growing up and you don't really know. When you're going to this earlier education socially, this is where you gain your social footing. So you learn how to share, how to be respectful, how to care for others, what a friend is. Because at home if you're not having this education, what are you supposed to do? These things carry on the rest of your lives. The higher education gets more specific and specific and specific it gets; how to make a friend. How do I know? How do I have respectful conversation with other people? Those are things that we have now, and I use every day, but I developed when I was younger and that's what builds the emotional intelligence.
But in addition to emotional intelligence, we think academic intelligence is great too. You learn to walk, learn. Teachers at a young age can make learning exciting. You're not going to be, sometimes when you get older and older, learning is you're going to class and you're like, ""Oh, whatever."" But these kids are still excited. They're still in their earlier age. I'll take you in one minute. Where they will be excited about learning and teachers can do that. These are equal in importance. Having the emotional intelligence, the academic intelligence. Why does more funding help with this? Better facilities for these kids can pay for better teachers who have more training and more education. That's the financial end. ",constructive1,mswan,round2,71.0,0
632,632,768,"Our third contention is role models. This is from a moral standpoint and it's also the period. So a lot of times, parents aren't always around, which is really sad. Parents might be dead, they might get incarcerated, they also just might not be present and invested in the education. But if we can invest in this, teachers are role models for these kids. You look up, imagine your three year old coming into school every day. Your teacher's like, ""Oh he's so tall. He's so cool. I want to be friends with him. Oh my gosh, that's amazing."" And like these teachers are role models that often in a perfect world, everyone would have a parent that helped guide them but that's not the world we reside in. These parents' limitations, shackle kids from really having that positive role model and seeing what they can then become. These teachers can provide a clear roadmap to that. They look up to them and what does that create a world? It creates a world of dreamers. That a future looking down the line, kids who want to do things with their life instead maybe you have a bad role model at home and you see your parents drinking alcohol all the time and just sitting around. You think that's your life path? But you see teachers going out and doing stuff and inspiring you to love yours and it inspires you to continue going.",constructive3,mswan,round2,71.0,0
633,633,769,"Our final thing is that children are creatures of habit and the fourth contention, 3.1, is that we're creatures of habit. The habits we build then, continue with us. I still write with a pencil the way that I normally write because I learned it when I was younger and these habits are going to stay with us for the rest of our life.

634,634,781,"Okay, so what does my partner bring to you here? First of all, funding these sorts of early childhood educational programs gives children the solid baseline education they need to be able to get into college in the first place, right? OO completely ignores this fact, and they think that if you give the funding to colleges and everything, you'll still be able to reap all these benefits. But that is simply not the case. They will just be reinforcing all the problems we have in the status quo for only certain types of people from certain backgrounds get to go to college, while there's all of these other types of people who are not able to get to college. Why? Because they didn't have these fundamental programs in their formational stages of life where they actually begin to have their education. They lose out on that. So then they're behind by the time they're already getting into mandatory grade school in some countries, right? If you didn't, if you weren't able to go to preschool or kindergarten, then you're already behind. You didn't get to start learning math and start learning reading to the same level that other children did when you first get into school. So you're already disadvantaged when you start, you're already behind. And that carries out through your entire education because generally this is a geographical issue. Many of the people with these problems are in the same area and they're going to the same schools. So you have an entire school of kids who are behind because they didn't have these early childhood programs. And so these areas and these demographics of people aren't going to have the same opportunity to get to college as kids from better off areas. So when we fund these sorts of programs, we actually get this solid baseline education for these children. They're able to actually catch up in their education, they're able to have a higher quality of education and it equalizes the entire system, and it gives them a better chance of being able to go to college later on, right? Without this sort of funding for these sorts of programs, you simply don't get that, right? And especially in developing countries who are in so many cases, these programs simply do not exist. It's not like maybe you can't afford to go to them or something, it's they just don't exist. So with this type of funding, not only are you able to subsidize it for people who maybe can't afford it, you're also able to give that money to actually start having these programs in some places that don't have it. And so now kids who maybe people weren't able to send them to preschool or school at all in lots of areas of rural [00:02:56] they don't even have child labor laws, so they just send their kids to go work or work for the family or something like that. Instead of sending them to school when they have that option of sending the child to school, which you only get on our side, and they're actually able to go get that education.",constructive1,nmasoom,round2,71.0,0
635,635,782,"That's where it begins, right? You start recognizing reading, you start recognizing numbers, you start learning math, you start that all at an early age, right? Your brain is developing at such a rapid rate at that age. It's so foundational to your development. That's where you begin actually learning these skills. That's why we have programs for kids these ages because that's so important for them and that's why we see it in places that don't have these kinds of programs. They have much more difficulty later in school when they don't have access to the same opportunities. The second thing my partner brings you is that having this sort of system in place where we're only funding this type of education and not secondary education is it lowers the importance of college.",constructive1,nmasoom,round2,71.0,0
636,636,783,"Now, okay, why do we want to do that? It sounds crazy, right? First of all, not everyone needs college, right? For some reason, in the developed world, we've gotten into this mentality that like, Oh, if you don't have a college degree, you're worthless, and OO acknowledges this. They say that college is just a signaling mechanism and that's absolutely right. It has a lot of it, for a lot of cases it doesn't have much value. As they said, many people can do any job, right? So the college degree is just a barrier for them anyway. If you put more of the funding onto these early childhood programs, then you're giving less importance to the college education, right? Because you're putting the funding elsewhere, you're signaling that, Hey, this college education isn't as important, right? So now that you get this idea that the college education isn't as important from the signaling that it doesn't need the funding and it's not as important as the actual primary school in early childhood. Then you get to see that the college thing is just a signaling thing and you can get many jobs, and many important jobs, in our society that either don't require a college degree right now and are pivotal to society working just having jobs like being a janitor, or a plumber, or truck drivers or things or a lot of stuff like that. They're necessary for our society. But right now people see those jobs as being lesser and people who do those jobs as being lesser because they think that Oh, you couldn't afford a college education, or Oh, you weren't good enough for a college education. When you lessen the importance of a college education, then that mentality starts to go away. And then we can also get rid of some of the payment disparity because now we recognize that these people are just as pivotal in our society as the people who got a college degree, which doesn't do much, so they're actually able to be paid better because you have that new mentality that it's not only the college degree that makes you worthy as a person. Yes.
But changing funding doesn't actually change the mentality employers have. It just means there's less people with that Bachelor's degree. It doesn't mean they value it any less.",constructive2,nmasoom,round2,71.0,0
637,637,785,"And so because we actually, on our side, we're able to get children the baseline education they need so that they can actually succeed and if they want to, or if they need to, if they have a job that actually needs a college degree, they're able to get better because everyone has that better lower level education. ",constructive1,nmasoom,round2,71.0,0
638,638,786,"But also, it lowers the importance of that education, so we no longer have to deal with that signaling effect that we talked about.

639,639,628,"But first, I'm just going to talk about a cool idea that I think my partner addressed really well on separating church and state. We're not a theocracy and this is not going to make us into one. This is actually going to lead us toward being a more secular state that is not based on religion. Especially when in Quebec, Christianity is the dominant religion, it has been for a long time. So this is actually over proportionally representing the dominant religion, and putting other smaller groups of religions after us. ",constructive1,mpoot,round5,70.0,0
640,640,629,"So again, I just want to be clear again, this bill does not discriminate based on which religion you're on. It talks about crosses, it talks about hijabs are just the example used in the motion, but it also includes all religious freedom, so it's not like it's saying ""Oh, Christians, you're fine to wear this, but the Muslims, absolutely not."" So it doesn't just discriminate on that, so it doesn't just discriminate against certain religious groups, and it actually helps groups who are in a smaller position because what it does...so it removes religion from specifically from provincial employees. So these are people who are being exposed. They're usually in government positions, they're teachers, they're federal, they're provincial employees who work in the government. So these are people who have massive impact in the way that our society runs which we do not again want that to be based on religion. Teachers are literally...they're in a position where they have massive influence on the people the students that they are teaching. So what we don't want is from a very young age to expose them, to just especially when you're in a place where there is a dominant religion, to what religion. If we have a bunch of teachers who are all religious and they're all Christian, that's not that they expose people, and I think it actually forces religious view on something that should be a secular thing, like school. ",constructive2,mpoot,round5,70.0,0
641,641,665,"Which I think leads to substantial backlash, both against religious groups and against the government as a whole. In a way that might undermine your rights in those religious groups because they have less political capital, they have less people collaborating with them and so on and so forth. But I also think that there is a very real pragmatic argument about what effects on the ground are we how people react to that minority and how people react to the federal government. So Colin gave you this argument about how people would hate on the minority group because they are perceived as the group that drains on the resources of the state. They're response here is ah, well the state is going to change their ways so they can get more money. I think oftentimes there are extremist cultural practices all the time that they talk about such that the calculation isn't pragmatic to begin with it's not based on that. I haven't seen a budget, no thanks.",constructive1,lorenpf1,round5,83.0,6
642,642,666,"But even if it is, it often times comes after feeling some sort of brunt from the lack of economic success. So maybe you go for two years and your state gets more soft and then you change your ways. We said if this is still enough for them to have significant resentment against particular minority groups, but more over, I think that there is likely to be some substantial backlash against the federal government. That is to say, a lot of people in these states are going to feel aggrieved that the federal government has been unwilling to support them or has been willing to intervene in this particular way. So we think that for the anti-religious groups that you're talking about. They're likely to become a more extremist and more people in those states who may entice particularly religious but are aggressively in favor of the independence of states, now move their political attack. Not to be on the state level, but to be on the government level that way. The possibility isn't that we get less respect for religious liberty at the state level, but it is that there is a change in federal policy.",constructive2,lorenpf1,round5,83.0,6
