1269,"comparative, when you have these currency ties between these nations, it means that when the other nations fail that is going to actually hurt your nation because it's going to like plummet the value of the currency or hurt the stability of it. But secondly is the financing all things within using that currency, whether it's debt that they need to be using that currency for or whether it's going to be hurting international trade. All those reasons are why they care. The members of ACIAR grow to care about each other when they're tied together with a currency like the comparative is that China is much easier able to pick off countries like Vietnam, Cambodia because they put their individual interests over that of Southeast Asia. We tip that balance towards Southeast Asia rather than individual interests when they're having to go China because of the fact that they care about, they care more about the success in Southeast Asia. Another way in which we place a third way in which we increased the ties between Southeast Asian nations is that when you decrease the transactions costs of trade and we'll need to have more trade presents within ACIAR itself, that means you've increased the regional ties between each other. That means you're more likely to say my economy is now as a larger share of that did buy trade within ACIAR as opposed to China, are willing to vote interest of ACIAR. Honestly, this idea of how they say it, if they have conflicting interest, why would they ever go and balance each other, bail each other out? That's a problem that exists right now in the status quo. That's what we're trying to solve. The comparative on their side is they go to places like the IMF and China that are horrible actors to get their loans, their loans and then debt finance. I think the horrible thing is that now that we get to change for our side is that we have a currency that ties in together and that when those individual nations fail, every nation within that system, especially the rich nations like Singapore are going to shell out the cash to make sure that those nations are able to rebound and the currency is able to be stable.",constructive1,,123dyly,round4,123dyly_round4,1.0,79.0
1270,"you're at the hands of actors who have an interest in growing your economy and actually caring about the regional interests that you face but evidence say that you're less able to print more money to pay off debts. I think this is the exact kind of incompetent monetary policy that we're trying to prevent. The kind of things that cause hyper inflation because you have a lack of transfer of information for regimes who are corrupt, have debt dealings with us. State owned enterprises that they use to propagate corruption that you mitigate on our side. When you tie nations together trying to help those nations actually like financially and economically recover. Even if you have one nation that is propped within that are or many nations that are propped within that sphere. Everybody has a collective interest in wanting the nations to succeed economically so you have more information going around as to what is the best move monetarily in order to heal those nations. I think when they say that thirdly that they have different contexts in which they're going to evaluate whether inflation is good, do we want the interest rate higher or low? All these things just recognize in ACIAR what ties them together relatively is that they're exporting nations that they want by a common interest in trade. Are they more over? You would also say that each of these nations within ACIAR, when they're governed monetary policy want to account for those different, who's differences and how they affect the economies because of the tight incentive that they have now. I think when they say that Singapore is a bigger economy of the end of their case, talking about how they're going to have the most power recognize that's in the status quo within the framework of ACIAR but also they should have the ability to within ACIAR to descend and generally they need to reach a consensus but then secondarily even if they have more power comparatively they care more in our world because they're able to bail out those countries.

First is on the idea on backlash, finishing off on like the idea of states seceding, then weighing about things why do you think religious freedom is worth defending? I think they very much undervalue the presence of case that talks about why religious liberty specifically needed to be defended because they're so important. And that when you don't defend them on their side of the house, when they try to take this very narrow pigeonholed idea of we're just going to talk about advocacy of defending religious freedom, they lose out a lot of ground in this debate.",constructive1,,123dyly,round5,123dyly_round5,1.0,79.0

76,"But third is that social contact and expression and normalizing that expression is the only hope for changing minds into the future. If you continue to have the state that lives where you ban all religious expression, like in terms of like wearing burkas, wearing crucifixes in public, what that means is that you have no social contact on their side and if you do, it's in private settings. That ends up extremely negative because you still have to make it meaning to normalize these people in the public eye in order to actually have contact with these people.

We've all been there where you've had a long drawn out argument, all the facts are on the table, everyone knows the same things, and yet you still don't agree just how you assess the world, your life experiences, how much you trust the government, how much you would like these people or that people. These things will always affect what you are willing to view as a reasonable argument. And so to try and cloak yourself away from this will allow yourself to just ignore this subjectivity and reasoning. Now where this becomes very important is a contemporary example such as that of trans people, who have experiences that can only be viewed through a subjective framework. Our modern understanding of gender cannot be physically observed. You can't find the gender in a microscope as far as we know yet. But for our current understanding, the only way to understand the issue properly is to listen to people. It is to take in these subjective experiences and give a modicum of trust towards it. And so once again, bringing the elephant in the room, Ben Shapiro, one of the issues is that people will discuss ... often it was appealed to the idea that ""Oh, trans people are just against basic biology,"" and so of course this is something that can be unpacked and debated further. However, for a significant basis of the population, just having that sort of idea of, ""Oh, it's just basic biology,"" is enough to cloak themselves in a very objective framework of feeling like they have reached the objective facts, but because they have not listened to the lived experiences and been able to get a more nuanced fleshed out view of the world it leads to systemic biases being reinforced, because many of these biases come from pre-existing power structures, things that have been implanted in people from childhood. And so because there is nothing that can be done to really take those biases out without proper exposure to new ideas or proper exposure to new subjective experiences, this idea of just staying objective, just ignoring feelings is a way to reinforce those power structures very easily.",constructive1,4.0,adamursenbach,round3,adamursenbach_round3,1.0,77.0

We think if, even if you care about them from zero to five, then they're forced into like elementary, middle, and high school education. That is fucking terrible, right? Because none, these policies solve for that elementary high school is still going to be terrible on both sides of house, which means we don't think it's going to lead to people dropping out of school because we think that the laws in these countries, in most countries forced kids to attend school right. You give incentives to parents to make kids go to school. What happens then immediately after school, we didn't the comparative on their side of the house as soon as kids finish high school it just, even if they, yeah, as soon as finish... kids finished high school they just drop out of school and take it on skilled labor job because it's seen as the one thing they need to do in order to support their families right.

Because it's seen as times that they contribute income to their families and help support things as men especially worse if their families have multiple kids like . We think that we think that on the compare we think that they don't go to college. On the other side of things, either college is unaffordable and not accessible. Our college is just not good enough and it starts something that is worth spending your time on. The comparative benefit of doing an unskilled labor job is probably hype. We think that giving them access to things like community colleges, giving them access to things like trade schools allows you to correct for this mess. Right? Because it allows more people to be more employable once they finish. These are these courses and all of that we did that was probably going to be more likely is that they see, they see these things as more viable alternatives because they're, they're more affordable now.

We think this was this just further, it's like systematic concentrated poverty traps where people just live in poverty stricken areas for the rest of their lives. What's the comparative? We think we've got more funding for education or outside. We think the longterm solvency happens because now people can escape the poverty trap, so now they can send their children to school and they can ensure that their children get a better education than they did and get a better life that they did.

That is the impact of the extension that Cojay brings to you that goes under addressed by the other side of the debate. So this idea of the narrative being skewed is especially important because on their side of the house people never actually engage with power structures. At best they engage with lived experiences to some extent, but they don't know why they should care about those lived experiences. There're no mechanisms to couch those lived experiences in the context of the larger structure of society and why we should therefore make a change. What do we hear from the government? We say people are just less likely to use emotion because they think their emotions and themselves are now valued less. But we think it's probably worse if you just stop using facts. Because then political discussion just goes absolutely nowhere because it's just people claiming victimization on both sides of the house and it doesn't actually go anywhere and nothing is passed.

And they are not able to export to Western countries the same way that they would if they had their own independent currency that was fluctuating and such. So what we see in your world is we see that these countries are getting taken advantage, not only in an inherent scale of what Singapore is going to want to do to raise the value of the currency, but also in that they do have different social structures that will inherently have different power levels within the ACN countries. It's just inherent to this debate. So, what my first theme is. The first theme is who gets the most net good on their Because Gov wants to claim that they do, which my partner tells me is completely wrong. So Gov tells you, on Front Gov, they tell you that this motion will foster communication and cooperation of ACN nations. What I am bringing to you is that the harms are created by raising the value of the currency. You're hurting the export economies of the poor nations within ACN. And that this is a harm that is going to develop on an economic stage that you cannot mitigate with your cooperation and claims that you haven't mechanized how other countries are going to invest in the ones that are hurt by this motion. So then Gov tells you that trade between these countries is important and tells you about, by raising the currency of the poor countries, there is a trade between these countries now, and then by having a similar currency is not going to expediate how much trade is done between these countries. Because right now trade is done between these countries and I don't think that he can say by having seen currency, it's going to foster that. I think it's actually going to hurt the countries that want to do the most trade with other nations that are within ACN.

So how are we actually doing away with this?

It's important because it means that people are more willing then to fight for those basic rights and know that they deserve certain basic things, that they are valuable as a human being, not as a product, not as a worker in a society or whatever, but certainly as a person. This is important to people wanting to then fight for rights in the future, whether as an adult later on and being politically active and then going to seek out change that that makes their lives better. told you that this is incredibly important for identity formation.

But furthermore we think what it does is it provides a better parental relationship in which the kids can understand that they are close with their parents, that they have a good support system where the parents actually care for them. Or even if the parents can't provide anything else because they don't have equity to give them or they can't give them a house or something, they know that they care about them. They know that there is somebody rooting for them at every turn, who wants them to be as successful as they want to be themselves.

135,"Why is this the case? So basically, it's because you need technically trained people to build the infrastructure of the economy and high school is not enough. In high school, you don't learn to be an engineer, you don't learn to be an accountant, you don't learn to provide the kinds of services that companies rely on. So you need to actually go to get... You need to go to a vocational school or you need to go to college. You need to go to some kind of institution, which prepares you for this kind of work so that you can actually help develop the economy. What does this look like? So in places like Zimbabwe or Peru or China, it means that you need electricians to go and electrify the rural countryside, to build roads to villages that were otherwise inaccessible and literally do not have access to any kind of education so far to begin with.",constructive1,,amspector100,round2,amspector100_round2,1.0,79.0

So we think that if you have these kinds of mid-skilled workers, you are likely to an incredible amount of economic growth. It's the infrastructure by which the economy runs and ultimately, when these jobs come in, right, it's going to help everyone.

The company sees a market opportunity and they go and you see economic development. Why does this matter more than any of the other arguments we've made? First, we think this matters more than OGs arguments about inclusivity in the labor force because if there aren't enough jobs to begin with, then guess who's going to get... Feel the full brunt of unemployment, we think it's people like women who people are more reluctant to hire in the first place because they have implicit biases, because they have stereotypes against these groups working in the workplace.",constructive2,,amspector100,round2,amspector100_round2,1.0,79.0
1271,"So first, about better economic policy. There's largely two reasons you've got this. First is I think you're getting more investment and more trade just because there's a lower currency risk when you have a centralized currency. There's two reasons for this case. First, internally there are zero currency risk. So when Thailand is trading with Cambodia when a business is investing in Cambodia, it means that the business does not have to worry that Cambodia's currency will collapse and all of their profits go to zero in a particular year. So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.
",constructive1,,amspector100,round4,amspector100_round4,1.0,80.0
1272,"So second, I want to talk about how you can get more stable monetary policy. That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability. That is to say, if there's more jobs for people, we think there's less political discontent. You're likely see the things like inflammation of the middle class and as a result, I don't know, it's just better",constructive2,,amspector100,round4,amspector100_round4,1.0,80.0
1273,"The second argument is about better economic and political integration. A couple of arguments on this. First, we think that with more trade you're likely to see more negotiating power for this block as a whole. That means that when China says, ""Hey Cambodia, we would like to do X, we would like to go on this particular Cambodia doesn't have to take the deal. Right? Cambodia isn't as... The ratio of power between Cambodia and China is still skewed to China side, but it gets better. So this means Cambodia can do things like incrementally advocate for better working conditions for people. It means it can incrementally advocate for slightly lower tariffs on its products so it can export things to China too. This is critical because, we think that these countries, especially if they're discussing to start a block, are smart enough not to dilute their comparative advantage, but at the same time ensure that there are basic guarantees of safety to things like their workers, like human rights and working conditions that are not available in these countries right now.",constructive3,,amspector100,round4,amspector100_round4,1.0,80.0

32,"So, with that said, let's talk about the extension. First, we think our side of the house looks more inclusive to minorities. Why is this the case? It's because we often think that religious political power is concentrated geographically. So, for example, church organizations, which are often quite political are concentrated in particular areas in the south, which means that if you have the states determinate, like not the federal state. If you have the local state with the provinces determining what religious liberty means, it is more likely to be dominated by religious groups more dominant in that particular state.",constructive2,,amspector100,round5,amspector100_round5,1.0,77.0

And, as a result, it has an obligation to guarantee them their basic rights and religion is one of their basic rights, right? Like it is something that defines your intuitions morally. It's something that defines which communities you live in, your identity. People literally take different jobs because it allows them to express themselves religiously.

So, I've already told you about why this is likely to turn to kind of succession that opening opposition has talked about. But, suppose we're wrong, and suppose taxes We think that that might actually be a good thing for the rest of the country because if tax is eventually likely to come back, their economy's going to collapse. All the politicians will be voted out, they'll come back to the fold. But we think that that is a massive signal to minorities across the country that the government is trying to include them. We think that it is likely to deter other states from doing these kinds of exclusions of religious parties. Also, I'll take over when I can.",constructive4,,amspector100,round5,amspector100_round5,1.0,77.0
1456,"how you see the world, but it compounds over time because it affects, literally, everything you learn. Literally, every social norm you see, you interpret through your own experience. It might start out pretty harmless as, ""I want to be on the soccer team,"" but eventually you start to believe things like, ""Oh, my preferences should be expressed by the government because I am special."" But, lastly, we also think this changes the way that people value success. That is to say, you learn to measure success as a differential. That is to be good. The encouragement you're seeing from an early age is to be better than someone else. So we think that you're more likely to focus on beating other people as opposed to just doing good things in the world. You're more likely to think, ""Well, if I want to live up to my parents' expectations that I am special, I have to be better than the other kid in my math class,"" as opposed to just thinking, ""Oh, it's good enough as long as I got an A minus or an A on the test."" So, what is the impact of this? We think, first, this just means people are worse to other people. Because they see themselves as better, they see themselves as deserving more, and, as a result, they're less likely to see other people as fully human as they are. And this is, yes, likely to be implicit because parents are, admittedly, going to, probably, try to prevent their kids from being full on racist on either side of the house, in many households. But, we think that this perniciously changes the way you view other people in lots of different interactions. Biases and racism are implicit, and they only get worse if you see yourself as special, if you see yourself at the top of society. And this outweighs all of the arguments government makes because, even if kids are more successful, it does not matter if they use that success to do things that are bad for people or if they do not give back to society. If you make a lot of money, if you do not give to charity, I don't frankly care. I think you're probably contributing to wealth [in the world 00:05:47].",constructive1,3.0,amspector100,round6,amspector100_round6,1.0,82.0
1457," But now, let's go to the second argument: about how you try harder and learn better on our side of the house. So, first, I think we're going to argue that kids learn that talent is innate, if parents tell them they're special, that if they're different than other people, right? So, we think that the moment you fail, either one of two things can happen: either your parents will start to seem less credible and you won't believe that you're special, which means, by the way, your relationship with your parents will get worse, or, alternatively, you'll think, ""I can't have failed because I am special. It is not me, it is the system that is the problem."" And either way, we either think you learn to give up or you don't actually learn to learn from your mistakes because your parents have not told you the truth, which is that hard work pays off, that, even if there are differences in any talent, hard work is the thing that, actually, will determine your success in life. Instead, they have told you that you are special and you don't actually learn to change your actions. But, second, we also think that you're not going to, necessarily, make bad decisions to begin with. If you think you are special, you're more likely to think, ""Well, since my parents love me so much, I must be really good at dance, so I don't need to practice before I get on the dance team."" And this interacts with the arguments OG gives you about people trying things they like. We think that you're more likely to be unprepared when you try them and become discouraged in the first place, if you do not believe that actions are the root of success, if you believe that there's something innate about yourself that your parents have taught you, right? So, if you want other people to be more successful in life, if you want them to try harder, we think that you should teach them that they should try, right? That they should actually do a lot, that they should work on to improve themselves, they are not inherently special and as a... [",constructive2,3.0,amspector100,round6,amspector100_round6,1.0,82.0

So when the thing that the Israeli people see right now, when they are forming a government, when there's a literal one boot difference or one siege difference between Netanyahu and Gantz, is Russia promising to attack Israel. That's going to make them want someone who has military experience, who's a military leader, who has been leading the country through turmoil for 14 years, someone like Netanyahu who's able to toe the line between protecting Israel without incurring Russian aggression. And you think OG might be right, like I don't really know, maybe Israel will not do these particular attacks against Syria because they don't want to take the risk with Russia.
We think however that they're just going to do things like overt attacks. What does this look like? It looks like funding groups inside Syria who combat Iranian and Russian influence, it looks like cyber attacks and things that you can trace easily back to Israel. We think that this is particularly important and unlikely to trigger a response because, A: Russia literally will not know that Israel cause the attacks because Israel has one of the best intelligence forces in the entire world. Additionally, it will not meet the threshold of the threat because Israel is not actually striking at Syria, Israel is literally funding another group to strike on Syria. And third, political sentiments in Russia prevents them from getting involved in a messy war, especially when their economy is doing pretty badly as it is right now, Without a clear act of aggression. I'll take you there. So why do we think this is worse for control over Syria? Why do we think this is worse for Russian interests? We think because, first, Israel has less control over these groups, so instead of just attacking military installations, there's likely to be more civilian casualties and ferment more unrest, and more dissatisfaction with the government, which cannot actually protect people. But does that mean because Israel can't be blamed for these attacks there's less incentive to keep these attacks clean because Israel is not the one who is punished for them? It is more likely that these attacks are likely to be bigger, messier, and more harmful to Russian influence.",constructive1,4.0,amspector100,round9,amspector100_round9,1.0,
1628,"This matters way more than Iranian oil. By the way, Russia is a net oil exporter. They do not buy oil from Iran. So the reason this matters more is a couple of reasons. First, because you need Chinese technology to build up your military and to build up your military strength. So if you believe that you want access to controlling countries like Syria in the future, or that you just want strong allies like OG the goals of CG and OG, you need a strong military, you need to be able to fund things. And we think that the US right now and China are the only ones who can manufacture semiconductors, which you need to build computers. So, right? If you do not have good access to Chinese technology, if you don't have access to Chinese military technology, you literally cannot build up your military. But second, we also think that China is the main buyer of Russian oil. They export $400 billion in oil and natural gas to China. We think that what the Chinese Russian relationship is not going to last, but it's probably going to get weaker because China does need to signal to the West that they are not on board with this policy, this is not what they were trying to do. We think that even if this number goes down to like $300 billion, this is what you massively tank the Russian economy. We think that this means that you have less ability to fund groups like Syria and actually make sure that Syria has control over its territory. Like CG tells you in the longterm, and this is not, does not just affect one country, but it affects every geopolitical interest Russia has.

Two situations that this can happen in. First, they use the local court system, right, of these new regimes. However, because, first off, many of these dictators acted in accordance with the law, seeing as they were the government, there is no standard to punish them again, as this nation looks towards regime building. Therefore, it is impossible to come up with a consistent legal standard. With that background, let's talk about why this is bad. First off, the community prosecuting it does not have these legal standards and therefore will go off of their own personal experiences.

First off, let's talk about the fact that they can't actually try everybody that's involved with this because these international courts are often costly, and they rely on other individuals to fly in and to figure out these situations. So often they'll go after the figureheads of these regimes or the perpetrators. That means that many of the actual individuals who were the ones who were on the ground, and are committing the crimes, don't get to go to jail or get to see justice enacted against them. Why is this bad? This means that because there is no clear distinction of what is considered a perpetrator and what isn't, many individuals who may have acted on their own volition, instead of actually being forced into a system where they're doing it, are never prosecuted and they're never held up to justice. Additionally, we have to talk about the fact that these international courts are acting according to Western evidential standards. If we look at the examples of the Rwandan genocide or the Yugoslavian civil war, it took up to 20 years for all this evidence to be collected. Because while these Western individuals were going in, many of the perpetrators were actively destroying. Which means that a lot of these facts that were needed for these trials were never done out, which means that justice was never brought on the individuals. Why does this matter? This matters because justice is not actually fulfilled. This means that the conflict in these countries never keeps going and there are two results, essentially, for these figureheads. Either they're convicted, which means that many of their base would be further emboldened against these Western actors and against these new courts, or they're set clear which means that what actually happens is that their base says, ""Okay, they did nothing wrong.

There is no need to get evidence that fully and says that these individuals are fully guilty. Rather, we look at what broadly happened and then we look to rebuild these groups of people and this society so that it's able to function again. Secondly is that these committees are looking towards the future. They're looking to set up institutions of governance that prevent rule by one tyrannical individual. They prevent rule from an ethnic group looking to exert their power over the others. And they set up this regime so that it has democratic institutions so that we can ensure the longterm stability of these countries in the future. Because we're looking towards state and institution building, we're looking towards the future so that in the long term this can never happen again while, at the same time, ensuring that there's at least some culpability from the actors who did engage in this bad behavior in the first place. And lastly, let's talk about the fact that there's much less polarization that will happen from the society, which is already torn from this conflict. They're torn apart on ethnic, on racial groups.

It's basically that when people are able to utilize their feelings and their subjective things in political debates. They're able to like shift the narrative how we talk about things. We think that nationalism and populism literally focused on being able to identify with someone's story. When Donald Trump gets up and talks to you about how the white people are being oppressed because people are coming from Mexico and taking their jobs, people identify with that. Although the facts don't really agree with that. The facts don't really say that. We see a large influx of people taking white people's jobs. Instead, politicians are able to manipulate these narratives that they craft in society and scare people and make them want to engage with them politically. This leads to two things. We think that when you focus on facts, both sides are going to benefit, but they're not going to benefit for society. The left is going to polarize its voters to be afraid of nationalists, they're going to be afraid of people who want to cut your social security, afraid of these things. When the facts may not agree with that. But also on the right, they craft these narratives that are going to lead you to hate the other side. Both sides want you to hate each other so you fear the other side. What happens when we vote out of fear and not out of objective truth? I think that what happens is it opens the door for a lot more oppressive policy. This is why Donald Trump is able to pass a law to do a lot of terrible things through executive orders and might have had a he had a Congress and power. Because he was able to write up these mandates that he gets through having a like a voting base that is scared because he manipulates how he engages.

It actually makes him more polarized on political sphere. This is incredibly bad for the engagement between opposite sides of political discourse.

This is especially bad when you have, let's say, Bernie Sanders, who has a black woman who is talking about how a certain policy affects her versus Trump, who gets a white family to talk about the exact opposite experience. Because people are biased, because people are racist, you're probably going to have people go with a narrative that is more palatable to them. So we have how it is substantially harder to inflate an individual experience, especially if it is alive, especially if it isn't on the same level as other people. Whereas, on our side, we have these rejected facts that are really important. What does opposing government try to say to us in response to a lot of this?

We're saying to not weaponize these narratives that cannot be disproven, and very often cause people to become more polarized in their own respective camps, which completely wipes out any good impacts of people joining political discourse, if a political discourse is terrible. Next, we say that people rarely listen to stories that they don't agree with in the first place. We talked about how they don't listen to these statistics. It's even worse with narrate. People will personally attack the survivors of the Parkland shooting, just because it doesn't agree with their conception of gun control. People will attack Greta Thunberg because she's talking about her own experience over Sweden, and people say she's too far removed to actually be relevant to this debate. So because people naturally have an aversion to stories that they don't agree with, because people naturally have a tendency to bully from the time that they're in middle school, people they don't agree with, it feels way easier to just dismiss the other side on the basis that their story isn't quite palatable to you. That they maybe were paid off protesters or demonstrators from the CIA, in the case of a lot of school shootings, the narrative that comes from the alt-right.

They rely on this for their analysis to work. The harm with that is now it becomes so much more expensive, the old rent. But secondly, and this deals with their analysis on how it shifts the discourse to the rental market. It does, but in a really harmful way, which is now wealthy people can say ""We're already being significant taxes on buying those homes. We should be able to spend slightly less on the cap of giving off those,that rent"". What does that mean for their overall case and argument on gentrification? Because let's be clear, the people who suffer gentrification by rent are far more vulnerable than those who do by home ownership.",constructive1,,dhananjay,round1,dhananjay_round1,1.0,83.0
915,"Three reasons why, and [Deb 00:00:03:25] had this in her speech and it's [Dominic 00:03:23] that does notice spots. Firstly, they're the most vulnerable people. You are more likely to be extremely poor if you are a renter than if you actually were able to own a home. You are more likely to be a minority who is not given a home for unfair reasons. We cared about you significantly more and whether you have a home or not. Secondly, more people rent than they own homes. Something which opening government wants to actually can see, which means that overall the people who get gentrified now in their world is a much larger, much more vulnerable stakeholder. But thirdly, there's a bigger marginal harm here, which is if you get gentrified out of the home ownership market, you might have to participate in the renting market. If you get gentrified out of the renting market, you have nowhere left to go. You either have to live off state housing, which is pathetic. All you have to be homeless. Both of those are absolutely horrible.",constructive1,,dhananjay,round1,dhananjay_round1,1.0,83.0

First, I want to point out individual personal benefits of home ownership, that was absolutely dropped by their side.

Okay. There are small homes, there are homes that are twice the size of this room. Very often people who rent, for CDs, feeders, events, then collect wealth and buy those homes and it's cheaper for them in the long term because rent over 20 years, it's more expensive than buying that home right now.

Because oftentimes it is a precursor to even get into the room in order to get an interview, right?

Secondly, we suggest you're much less likely to drop out on our side of the house, insofar as you now know that there's a future that exists for you that you can then get into, which in many circumstances is the decision maker between choosing to drop out at 16 when you know that there isn't a future for you in education and choosing to go into this institution when you know that you have the pathway there for you.",constructive1,,ecurry,round2,ecurry_round2,1.0,80.0

And it's that you are now much more able to decolonize academia as a whole.

Because maybe it's true that there's going to be less funding for low income students who access post-secondary education later in life, but this is fine because even if they don't have much savings, ameliorating the massive amount of upfront costs that working parents need to spend early in the child's life and pushing that later back, it gives the parents some potential to save at least anything they have.

If you are with say a grandparent all day, or with any sort of family friend who's there to help you while your parents work, you're not going to be around things like your peers. This is bad because when children are not exposed to this, once they are entered in public school, which is generally sort of lower quality because of the way that American public schools are funded by property taxes, so low income children already attend lower quality schools in the first place. But generally this is magnified because now by the time they get to these schools, once they're in kindergarten, when public school becomes free and the status quo, suddenly they've had much less exposure to socialization; they're less able to grow, interact with their peers, or learn cooperatively as opposed to state children in middle-class neighborhoods, or children who attend wealthy private schools, whose parents have already provided them something like daycare or nursery school, who are much better off. They learn by example of directed peers.",constructive2,,eslondon,round2,eslondon_round2,1.0,77.0
168,We think sort of socializing at an earlier age.

Because when children who've had not received secondary early childhood care entered schools in the status quo, there oftentimes trapped to things like remedial education because unlike some of their peers who may have been wealthier and able to afford daycare or pre-K, these children are not. It sort of shows that they sort of perform behind even if they aren't necessarily meeting standards perceptually because they aren't doing as well as their peers. It gives teachers an incentive to try and trap them back into the worst classes or even sort of hold them behind. Right. Limit their ability to educate themselves further.

Throughout your life you're always able remember things, but as an early childhood, your brain is most malleable and most open to availment. We say if you're going to try and socialize people, but you should try and do it as early as possible. If you want children to become familiar with interacting with the peers, familiar with their schools, and have trust in the overall system, sort of enthusiasm and opportunity in school.

Because when you're sort of more familiar with schools, or, better comfortable with your peers, you care about school or I think you can be enthusiastic about education, get better grades, feel like you have a place in your school and you not have a reason to drop out. This is why drop out rates are so abysmal - or rather- so high in low income areas right now. We sort of solve that for this by staring at the root cause, the children and feeling alienated and unfamiliar with school. It's just super important because one, this would lead to sort of better life outcomes, a more optimal target.

Basically feel like having the ability to have more options to choose from because you're getting advice, working in vice and working knowledge from other people leads you to have a greater satisfaction because of the higher likelihood that you're going to find the option.

We feel like this is again specifically a dangerous in a sense that children don't necessarily have the solutions to everything specifically when you get into your teenage years. You don't know anything when it comes to drugs, alcohol, sexual assault, those are things that parents have much more experience for and their very helpful assistance. I think most of them think that this hurts like peer relationships in a sense that it makes them a lot less approachable if children think again that they have a predisposition to have a greater understanding of the world than their peers, but this is going to have distance though in the sense that they're always relating things back to their sense of self because they believe that their experiences are more valid than others, feel like that could apparently just damage pure relationships. Again how is this not the truth on our side? We feel that if children are raised to believe that they are equal to other people, they're more likely to rely on others, because they see inherent value in having people exchange a friendship and ideas with another person.  Additionally, we feel if they understand that there's a possibility to fail, the possibility to do poorly, that they're going to be more likely to seek out advice from both peers and parents. It's just something that has inherent value because a singular person can't know everything, can't have the perspective of a hundred different situations. Again, why do we care about this? As I explained earlier, as children grow up parents, I think they'll steer them of danger because if they're more understanding that their viewpoint isn't the only correct one, they understand that they are not special beings, that they also need other people in their lives. I feel like that means that they're more likely to not only to listen to advice but to also accept the advice they're getting from their parents about more issues that they might not understand, but additionally for this translates and appears specifically into issues with mental health. Not feeling alone, knowing that someone's in there in the same experience that you are having. For those reasons we are very proud to oppose.

So, even if the parent is doing something like reading to the child, it's not going to be as good a development for the child as something like daycare at a school because they're specialist insurance at best. But, it also harms the parent. There are many people who are forced to stay home because they can't afford $1,200 a month for daycare. So, what happens then?

If they have some disease.

This looks like two things. In more vulnerable communities, the attention that they give to the children, is implicitly connected to their safety, because a parent needs to be very attentive to the child. That child needs to be safe, because a child cannot be at home alone in a neighborhood that is dangerous because the parents don't have the financial stability to move them into a safer neighborhood. Because a daycare is very effective and because of that, access to a school that is safe with getting communities...

That's reinvesting, therefore, into the economy by increasing our activity on behalf of the parents. But secondly, we also think that the parents...

The research that scientists have about global warming, about how it is a certainty, right? It is projecting the objective truths of our debate, that still happened in the study school.

These universities tend to spend millions of advertising, not letting in financially disadvantaged children, and these universities are likely to overestimate their own value.

You can informally do childcare. Why is it better to formally do childcare through professional institutions? Two reasons. First, in a world of informal childcare, if poor people are just saying to family friends or like relatives, please take care of my child, they'll stay at your house for this bit while I'm out at work. They're significantly more likely to be abused, treated badly, et cetera.

The reason we like leftist opinions I think objectively and straight is because we think we're generally right about the world. We think that there is discrimination. We think there is sexism, we think there is all classism, but what structural aspects of personal narratives diffuse this, three. First, any argument against a personal narrative is then perceived as a personal attack. If you have someone whose objective, emotional experience is just like my family was attacked by immigrants and you're just like immigrants statistically don't really commit crime or the people, but, my family was attacked by immigrants. When you give that narrative the same emotional weight, comfortability and acceptance by like a swing voter who's just like, man, that statistic and like, God, I love this narrative. That is what results. If that's the case, then you get worse debate because you can't deflate narratives that are lies because you can't attack a narrative on its merits. It's in a narrative that you can't refute. Second, there's perceived as legitimately contested there. Unless you have a countervailing narrative. What this creates is a race to get the most marginalized person on your talk show. It's like, see if like one talk show comes up with like a Brown person is just like, this person thinks this about Trudeau's random black face or Brown face. And then the next conservative talk show, we'll try to find like Dinesh D'Souza to like say something about how Brown face is good and it creates like inclusionary politics because he's a conservative pack.

There's no narrative to tell me that debate is about putting stuff that I think about the world on the chopping block to see what people have to say about it. This is the highest probability impact because regardless of whatever mechanisms you think affect people's political discourse. Political debate is important because it encourages people to go through first, second, and third line responses to their positions. Anticipate the objections that they're talking about, deal with the research. If they have a study that disagrees with them, find another study, deal with the methodology of that study.

I think that when you sort of like praise a specific achievement that you want your child to have, you say ""You are perfect for this role and I'm so glad that like I have you in my life, it's like how good you are at this specific thing and that's the type of relationship with Kevin, your child."" Any case in which they want to stray away from that goal. So when they added all that, there was parents that described that role where they have in society, they don't want to fulfill that role for whatever reason. Maybe that role is misogynistic, maybe they're not interested in anymore or maybe they're incapable of succeeding in that goal. The reason why it is so especially harmful, is because now that all that outcome, that specific thing that you've created, is tied to the relationship I have with you, and also because you're instilling these ideas on them at such a young age, to their own self-worth.

This is incredibly important because we recognize that, when we live in certain worlds, where you are born with certain privileges, you reject the idea, and you live in a world where you don't understand other people who are not so privileged. We recognize that like a majority of the rich people don't have a good understanding of welfare, and that welfare is, there's a lot of problems with, with issues involved with. So what that means is that these people who actually are living in those conditions that are under like social policy, but who live at other social support systems that currently don't actually who are, which is very, which have a lot of systemic problematic issues aren't able to help these people out. So we recognize that current problems with welfare include, one, you have to, there problems with welfare, you have to fill out, Those processing times can take like two months, all the way up to like two something years. Recognize that's incredibly harmful, but on when you're, but when you're privileged and you don't understand that how all these intricate policies, and how all these paperwork work. We recognize that, they'd be like, Oh, why don't we just provide them funding or welfare. But that does not address the fact that people have needs, that needs to be addressed right now. And recognize the only through personal stories and explanations as to why these social issues are, why these policies are currently backed through personal experiences can actually bring about light and problems that are problematic inside our society. So when we also improve, we talk about personal emotions, we also not only help people with welfare, it also helps people that are in the minorities that are affected. We recognize the reason why this helps the minorities is because, it's because people are empathetic. People recognize emotion and that's the only one thing that actually relates people to each other. We recognize that by having emotions, you're able to connect with people because you recognize that, that could have been me, if I was not, if I was just born with less privileges.",constructive1,,jhuang,round3,jhuang_round3,1.0,77.0
593,"like minorities, that are directly affected, and that results in better policies being made. Let's talk about some refutation that we, from what we heard from opposition. Opposition give first, tries to give you the idea that politicians do stories to sort of hide their policies. We recognize that that's it, versus let's say inherent assumption. The reason why we think that's an assumption is that we, politicians, we believe, that have the general interest of the public at their hearts. But the reason why they do, is because they need folks to win. So what that means is that they generally are ready, try to propose policies and changes that really affect, are beneficial to those. They're incentivized to create policy that are beneficial to the people, to the voter base that they're emotionally engaging with. We think that, on that I know like that point falls. So then they tell you that even if, politicians will hide sources. So even if we buy their argument, why do we recognize that this is still, this still doesn't really make that much sense. We recognize that because if policies don't actually make changes that affect the people on the ground, we recognize that these politicians will lose support from the population and from the public and there'll be voted out through the next election. So even if that happens, we still, we don't, we still don't think that their point really stands. I mean we give you the example of the ideas like of Trump appealing to candidates in the Rust Belt. So we recognize that Trump actually correctly identifies for the issues, people are losing jobs in the Rust Belt, people are losing manufacturing jobs. And so those are legitimate problems that people can identify with. And he used strong emotions to be able to connect with these people. What did we hear from the Democrats? They did not actually engage with these people's response. They tell you people was that America's already great. And what that means is that people were not looking into her policies and stuff like that. So this is why we think it's important to actually have emotional response, in being able to connect with the general public is because it actually improves the general engagement in policies.

But then in real life when you actually go out and try to take these standardized testings and things like that and you recognize 'wow, I didn't actually make it'. We'd think that this is very harmful to a child's self esteem because throughout their whole entire life that they've been told that they've been the very best and when they actually step up to the plate and try to do it, they fail. We recognize that not every single person in this role is going to be like the Bill Gates or like the Mark Zuckerbergs, right? And when we try to portray the idea that every single person has the ability to actually achieve that we recognize it's incredibly harmful. Why do we think this is the case? It's because we just don't buy the fact that every single person has the ability to actually be a Mark Zuckerberg or be like Bill Gates or like someone that's super out of the way that is able to revolutionize the way that the world works. The reason why we think that this case is because people end up with a place where they're just like 'Oh, I'm just content with life'. Right? And because of that, because we learned that eventually when you get older you learn the idea of 'Oh, we should just settle for something because pursuing certain things it's just not worth it', right?

Even though, other kids... We recognize that this is basically a way of perpetuating the idea of bullying and things like that, right?

1643,"First on Israel's interest in Syria. Recognizing Israel's longterm interest in Syria is not merely the removal of Iranian influence. It is the longterm destabilization and weakness of the Syrian state. Iranian influence is merely a Trojan horse for that because Iran and Russia are significant factors of Assad. Why is this the case? Firstly Israel on face prefers weaker Arab neighbors because it means they pose less of a military threat. They can provide less support for groups like Hamas or the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Is why Israel has resorted to direct force to it's Arab neighbors before when they invaded Lebanon for 25 years. Secondly, Israel wants a buffer zone in the Golan Heights. It's a territory they've had for a long time and they want to expand it to some extent. Note this is much more possible with a destabilized Syrian state than one which is unified and powerful. Thirdly, the presence of destabilization on Israel's frontiers is what feeds the permanent militarization of Israeli society. Something that is inherently within its interests. It's by the way all those alternatives, sending ships full of money to Iran, won't work because it's not just about helping your ally. It's about ensuring that any force that tries to create structural destabilization within your allies has to be countered. So why exactly do all the things I talked about of Israeli interests necessarily counter Russian interest. Not withstanding the fact that Russia wants allies, which is kind of obvious, but note that there are things directly within Syria on the ground that Russia has a significant stake in. Firstly overseas military presences that aren't just about counting up the number of bases you have and saying we have 150 we're now a mid-sized power now. It's the fact that Syrian has provided Russia with a warm water port, which the overarching goal of Russian Naval foreign policies. It's something that Russia has in virtually no other part of its country and needs overseas expansion for. Syria with its dependence on Russia is one of the only countries that has been willing to provide this. Note, by the way, that leasing a military base requires a stable Assad government to be willing to provide this, something that Israel fundamentally does not want.",constructive1,5.0,jk2793,round9,jk2793_round9,1.0,
1644,"Secondly, economic importance. Things like control over pipelines, control over sector of the economy, public goods and stuff like that is something Russia currently has control over but is less likely to have control over if a government is significantly weak. Only a stable Syrian state had the capacity to provide this for Russia contrary to long term interest of Israel, and not only is Assad the only person who was able to provide this stability. Note that it is the only person who is willing to provide the benefits of the stability to Russia because virtually everyone else in the conflict is funded by the CIA and the Saudis. Meaning that this is Russia's only capacity to gain the structural benefits it wants from Syria. Will this start World War 3? No. For all the reasons I explained, the incentive Russia has in Syria is significantly stronger than the incentive Russia has in Israel. My appeal by, the one on Ukraine, kind of demonstrate this. America had a security commitment to Ukraine. Russia has much deeper structural reasons to want to destabilize Ukraine. America did not start World World 3. Secondly, note by the way, that if their argument is odd, the U S will retaliate. Note this logic works both ways because the U S knows that if it retaliates or Israel retaliates, then it has the possibility of starting World War 3, which means that the U S itself could put pressure on Israel to back up. Note, by the way, that the fact that the only they have is the possibility of a U S response demonstrates the implicit weakness of the Israeli bargaining position on our side of the house. Meaning that if we can prove that America won't nuke Moscow in exchange for this, then they have literally no leverage on their side.",constructive2,4.0,jk2793,round9,jk2793_round9,1.0,

So as the opening government points out, the conflict is essentially winding down the rebels and oppositions have got owned and they're losing control over most major territory, cities, they're gradually winding down. The major interest now is essentially called a post-conflict settlement in Syria will be arranged and what the postwar Syria government and economy will look like. The level of control that the Syrian Russian Iranian Alliance has over Syria will determine leverage. Both in the amount of territory they hold, but also in the territory that they hold the amount of control they have. That is to say Israel's actions necessarily undermine the Iranian Syrian Russian Alliance because not only are they providing air support to the rebels and undermining territorial gains, but in the places where the Iranians and Syrians have gained control that undermine their control there by bombing them. Means that, also important because the revolution government has below are some of the best soldiers on the Syrian side of the conflict, so undermining them provides a strong weakness. I'll take a few lines. No? Okay, cool. By ensuring Assad and Iran full or near total control over as much of Syria as possible, not undermined by Israel. It means Russia will have to make significantly less concessions if not, no concessions at all in whatever negotiations, if negotiations even happen to the Israel Saudi Arabia American alliance. It's especially important because even though the American nominal primary goal in Syria is the removal of Assad ,note that they've essentially given up on this goal because every attempt they've tried to do it has failed. It means that to the extent that the United States and Israel and Saudi Arabia has any leverage in the post-conflict negotiation, that leverage will be used to try to minimize Russian influence because they know they can't get rid of Assad. It means that this is exactly the scenario Russia needs to counter. Russia has longterm incentives in ensuring that they have a stake in Syria, militarily, politically, and economically, and only by strengthen and negotiating their side to the maximal extent possible.

We believe, first of all, the vast majority of individuals are suffering from the label of mediocrity to begin with? Why so? Because these kids are unable to accept when they're older. Why? Before I move on to the extension. Why is the definition of special necessarily meaning best? As Justin mentioned before, apparently all of us are special. Why can't more than one person be special if all of us are special in our own ways? Special by definition means you're better than others. So if you aren't special, that means by default you are ordinary and average so we don't understand where that comparison comes from. Right? So we believe that average kids, ordinary kids are majority of individuals. Because at the end of the day when kids grow up we're not all revolutionary changes of the world. We often are all fitting into the nine to five jobs like the average Joe. And that's when its problematic because these individuals find it hard to accept that they're in this situation. So moving on- Not taken. Why is it harmful for these individuals when they're unable to accept it when they're older? Most kids grow up to have either average grades or do things like nine to five jobs and things like that. Not taken. They dwell in unsatisfaction because they are unable to accept that they aren't exceptional. Meaning the problem is majority is looked down upon within society. In society, you as an individual are only celebrated when you are unique and you are different from majority. That is problematic because then majority of individuals are unable to accept that everyone around them is like them and they are like everyone around them. So that means when these people, when they go to work, when they go to school and they see they're just like everyone else and they're not different and they don't have a set value or a set of skill that maybe gives them an intrinsic value or an exceptional in society, that is problematic because then one, these people are more likely to hate themselves because they were unable to fulfill the goals that were set for them by their family.",constructive1,4.0,jumzthewarrior,round6,jumzthewarrior_round6,1.0,77.0

1682,"parents strains the relationship between parents and children. And this is the idea of teach versus tell. But that also goes into the point that C.G. made, saying that children are special in different ways. They're told they're special as a reaction to past success and actions. So if you're smart and you're talented and people are always telling you that you're special and that you should do this or that when you grow up, that is a pressure that's placed on you, that forms a barrier between you and the rest of the world because you are acting as a lone agent in trying to accomplish this goal when you might not have the ability to do so. And this is the idea of teach versus tell, going beyond the idea of specialness. So when Amy talked about teach versus tell, she was basically saying that instead of telling your children that they're special and telling them that they should be accomplishing the most incredible feats that humans are capable of, like is often implied in this term, she's saying that we should be going beyond that and teaching them to live lives that are more fulfilling than the idea that they should have certain goals. This results in burnout, either because of lack of talent or talent limit, just not being able to progress as far as some other people are, or disinterests. So a lot of people when they have their idea of specialness instilled in them, when they start dance, when they're five years old and they go all through high school and their parents say, ""Oh, you should be a famous dancer one day. You're going to be a professional dancer."" That often declines in time over interest. And so a lot of times people lose their idea that they can be worth anything if they aren't focusing on the ideas that they go through when their children... Yes. I don't think that that's necessarily true because even if you tell a child that they're special, it doesn't mean that... If anything, it puts more pressure on them.

When you grow up doing a certain thing, like if you grow up in theater and you're always getting roles and everything and you go off to theater school and then you can't find a job outside of that, that causes inherent harm.

The people living in your area just at least see housing prices go up over time, indefinitely and permanently into the future.

This leads to homelessness, gentrification, people being driven out their homes. People not being able to afford rent, or even if they do afford rent, they can't afford anything else like education and healthcare and this is the major problem that we need to solve.

We want to incentivize people to sell land like that so then they can be more efficiently reallocated to people who need it, right? So how does our mechanism solve this works? The tax solves this because people are now incentivized to sell this piece of land because now the cost of maintaining that piece of land pay taxes and stuff is much less than the benefit of having a larger home for instance, or having a home that your family has lived in for a very long time.",constructive1,,kolyncheang,round1,kolyncheang_round1,1.0,80.0

For instance, cities like Detroit or manufacturing cities that are slowly going out of business, you can easily just stop your lease like as long as you aren't on a lease for five years.

So what you get is a situation where people have to deal with their mortgage on their house that they bought because they couldn't afford it in the first place, and it was hard to deal with this house that they now can't resell. Or if they do resell it, they're going to resell it for a loss causing incurrence of massive debt because sometimes these houses you need to get a loan in the first place and not a hope that you could actually afford.

They can afford to give loans to some people who will never be able to pay back their mortgage, and in fact, they actively try to give loans to these individuals so that they'll be able to foreclose those homes in the future and get assets back on them.

So Colin gave you this argument about how people would hate on the minority group because they are perceived as the group that drains on the resources of the state. They're response here is ah, well the state is going to change their ways so they can get more money.

That is to say, a lot of people in these states are going to feel aggrieved that the federal government has been unwilling to support them or has been willing to intervene in this particular way. So we think that for the anti-religious groups that you're talking about. They're likely to become a more extremist and more people in those states who may entice particularly religious but are aggressively in favor of the independence of states, now move their political attack.

1414,"So first, children are inherently the most vulnerable group of a society. They have no agency and they exist in a state where they have to exist as the result of something else. So children don't make their own decisions. Decisions are made for them, but in certain situations, the decisions are not made by the parents rather made by the institutions and the society within which we exist. What I'm talking about here is how lower income families traditionally have almost no access to childcare and even if they do, it's often lower quality and not done in a way that supports the interests of the children or the parents. In the status quo there is no supplementary childcare. Everything is paid for out of pocket and this gets very problematic in a lot of different situations. The biggest one is in medical support. Childcare inherently means getting access to medical support and access to education and then access for parents to be able to interact with their children when they want to. The reason why the medical support issue is so bad is when you are in your formative years, there are many things that can affect your development. In many cases not getting the right amount of nutrients can actually severely damage you growing up and this house doesn't want to see that. For example, in Ecuador and Uganda, there are currently numerous problems being associated with children not being able to get enough calcium in their diet, which means they have weaker bone structures, but also means they start developing kidney problems and eyesight problems as early as seven. That's terrifying. This house addresses that problem.",constructive1,3.0,ls5871,round2,ls5871_round2,1.0,78.0
1415,"The second point I want to get in this point is that the privatization of this industry is inherently bad. The best example I can cite for this is the preschool industry in New York City where you have these parents who are forced to pay $20,000 to $30,000 a year just so their children can get a preschool education. That is ridiculous and it's inherently inequitable because the only people who can afford that are the wealthy. But as the government and as any rational person would say, we have to care about all children, not just the children of the wealthy, and that's what we address. I'm going to move into a subpoint of this, which is parents also have needs. It's been proven that when parents can't consistently form bonds with the children, it leads to a lower quality of life for the parent, as well as the child. And in a world without support for childcare, there is no support structure that allows parents to, I don't know, take time off work so they can be with their children or be able to leave their job if they have to go to school to help their child. There is no support for that and that's inherently bad. But secondary education, this is where I get into my second point, it exists in systems without governmental support for it. Private institutions have persisted since the 1400s and they do so by first of all the amount of wealth that they themselves can levy as a private institution, which means they don't need governmental assistance. They don't. They have wealth. And second of all, loan programs still exist, even if the government doesn't have the resources to give loans, there are still privatized loans. And I know what opposition is going to say is that these privatized loans are either predatory or that they have bad interest rates. But they're actually a lot of companies that have broken the stereotypical classification.",constructive2,3.0,ls5871,round2,ls5871_round2,1.0,78.0
1416,"Now my third point is how the needs for post-secondary education have been decreasing yet this postnatal and early childhood has persisted throughout all of history. So landmark companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, all of them are actually reducing their requirements for traditional post-secondary degrees. And instead focusing on applicants who have experience precisely because they understand that it is an inequitable system to require everybody to have a post-secondary degree, that's just not feasible. And as a result, we can see that many companies are moving away from this, yet children are still going to be children.  They're still going to need access to their parents. They're still going to need medical care and they still need education. That's not going to change. And it's going to change for the worst if you take away any funding that you could possibly give to these children. And the side that wins this debate is the side that supports the most vulnerable groups. And I believe opposition is going to attempt to tell you that students are vulnerable, but children are far more vulnerable than post-secondary students. And that is why we have not only the moral obligation to help them, but also from a point of ethics we can't let children be underrepresented in society.

We think that leads to better impacts. Let's talk about that half a little bit as well. So back half tries to give this about like dealing immigrants, right? We think that this power narrative still applies because when you're dealing with narratives about immigrants, you have two very competing narratives. One is completely true, one is completely untrue about criminals, like immigrants being criminals versus immigrants being poor and struggling, right?

That's the conception of hard work, leading to success being legitimate. But that ignores the reasons why people are more capable of doing hard work. Questions of ability and questions of circumstance, the wealth you grew up in? I think that this means that you're unlikely to actually have an understanding of what means,... Why the conception of hard work and capitalist society is flawed. I think if you tell kids, everyone deserves something, you're likely to wonder why, what is that discrepancy between what this person deserves and what they have. Because everyone deserves the same access to resources. No, just raise your hand. I'll see you. I think notably the problem is that this means that kids are going to grow up to be people who oppose things like affirmative action. Appose things like massive taxation and the wealthy because of you and your parents worked for things and you deserve things. Then why should those things be taken away? You deserve the maximum amount of yourself. I think this means that then you're unlikely to understand these barriers that exist and are likely to want to agitate to change the system. Notably there's a big wave of socialism right now that I think could actually be a successful thing in changing the minds of people in the future. Youth tend to be, I'm going to be down a lot more progressive in their views and able to overturn structures of capitalism, even if it's just small steps like universal healthcare. I think that is massively hindered when children are brought up in a way that tells them they deserve the things they have, and this is very hard to then account for why they should lose those things to help other people. It's a new liberal excuse to allow bad policy once you're in an adult to say, well, I deserve things. I'm capable and I have those things. On the self, I think this is a problem because it creates an idealized mindset that's difficult to reconcile with the real world things that happen.

The fact that you're failing on the capacity to deserve everything is because you are somehow you made a failure along the way, because, you were perfectly capable to achieve that thing that you deserve. I think this is really hurtful for people because, first of all, you've been told that you, especially, capable that removes nuance and barriers. For example, people of color, women who have harder tens in getting jobs and things like that. But I think it also means that you might just not be as capable. I have the disability who thinks a lot slower than everyone else. This means I'm not going to succeed in the same aspect. You look at an office job and I think that's fine, but I need to understand that I'm going to have the capacity to succeed in this world. I think to tell someone that they're equally capable, but then they notice that there are limitations, for example, on mental health into their capacity to succeed. Because, it's not productive to their way to be able to cope for those things. Notably when you need to be able to do, is to access convictions and self advocate, but you cannot do that.

No parent is going to opt in to say, ""You're unique because your eyebrows are very bushy,"" right? It'll be something else entirely. They're going to be super confident, right? The problem with this is you'll end up thinking that you are superior to others because your uniqueness manifests itself in a way that is most valuable to you instead of a way that is most valuable to others. We think that this is leading to A, things like decreases in empathy; because you relate to others less, because you view yourself as standing above them. We think that can lead to terrible antisocial behaviors or, at the very least, an internalization of hatred to others, particularly when they're young, for going beyond.

1659,"Secondly, though, in terms of motivation, we think that we change the motivational nexus. We think if you think that you are intrinsically valuable, then that motivates you, not because you want to do more work, but because you think it's deserved to you. We think, therefor, that you are less likely to put in more copious amounts of effort. That if you knew that you had to work harder because you're starting at the same starting block as many people within your immediate socio-economic vicinity. We think that telling people that they are at the same place, at the very least, is going to motivate them to work harder, even if it's only within a limited socio-economic block within their peer group. If you think that you deserve more, I think you're going to put less work in. That's the problem of being egotistical. Secondly, our desserts, right? We think that when everyone wants to get what they deserve, they end up taking riskier behaviors. If you think that you are special and you deserve great things, and that you are special and you've got great talents, then you're more likely to behave in risky ways. We think that this causes social harms to others, particularly because, may we think prudently, investing your money in ... market tracking yield, market tracking funds instead of triple-letter GTFs as more likely to build up wealth, especially if you come from other socio-economic background. But, moreover than that, I think you are less likely to throw people under the bus in a dog-eat-dog world if you understand that everything is before basis, likely that we are all equal intrinsically, and that you're less likely to not be empathetic in a risky competition.",constructive4,3.0,noahmacdonald,round6,noahmacdonald_round6,1.0,78.0

First of all, I think that this creates immense psychological distress. If you end up in an average job with an average life, just the same as everyone else, I think that you either internalize that as you haven't lived up to your own goals, or you start blaming others and it becomes incredibly toxic. Then you're more likely to lash out your peers from a likely antisocial behavior. But, more importantly than that, we think that parents are an important act for this round. We think that they frequently get these kinds of things wrong. So likely, you're not going to tell your kid that, ""You are special"" in the way that they're actually special if they do have any talents, but instead, they're going to be like, ""Oh, you tested high in the math score. We're going to try to get you into math decathlon."" Or, ""Oh, you happen to be good at speaking.

We believe that things should be done to prevent the rise of these populous leaders, because we believe they give a net harm to society, but disagrees. Given that by oppositions of the framework, if people who have implicit biases are already less ... have less of a tendency to care about these minorities, why would these facts be more likely to sway them, better than empathy for the people who are suffering within these conditions?

We believe that this is the kind of applying the empathy you already have to facts given to you that is going to bring us this debate on our side that helps. We don't believe that you shouldn't have empathy at all, but we don't believe that you should base politic- that leaders should pander to you with emotions, and tell you the emotion you should feel about policies.

Firstly, these subnations don't have enough tax base to actually implement their big infrastructure projects. For example, Quebec. Quebec only has a few cities that it can draw money from, but the entirety of Canada has multiple ports and other cities that they can take taxes from. Often these discriminatory laws are implemented in places that have less income and less money associated with them. That is because religious bigotry and other types of discriminatory behavior are often seen in these areas that don't have a lot of interaction and who aren't liberalized, who aren't like the coastal elite places. As a result, we will see these laws more likely in North Dakota than in New York.

The only people in the status quo who are voicing concern about this policy is the religious minority themselves.

That is, you learn that in order to be worthy, you have to be special. That becomes the way you determines whether you succeed. It is not, ""Have I worked hard?"" Or, ""Have I done pretty well?""

What happens then, is that you think that, one, that is the standard you hold yourself to, that you have to be special and second you breathe, you aren't.

Instead of learning from those failures, they lash out when they get negative feedback that contradicts their self image. This is really bad, because it means that you get less hard work. That is, they say that you feel like a disappointment. We think that disappointment motivates you to work harder in a world where you say that that disappointment isn't inherent to your being.

They matter to them as a person and they may draw in more voters, but that doesn't display to the voters who they're voting for and who they're putting their support. I think the biggest example of this in the current day is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris when they had that huge blowout over what happened in the past. That is not who Joe Biden is today and yes, while Kamala's policies remain that way because that is her lived experience, she talked about what happened to her and not what she was going to do about it in the present, which yes allows people to see who they were, but now who they are or what they will do in office, which we believe is more important than anything else in this debate because it allows voters, even if it is a smaller, more knowledgeable population, to put people into office that they can actually trust and support.

When we apply this idea of allowing the presentation of what's going on to be applied to both sides of the aisle. So when patterns don't equal action, we get people who lie about their personal experiences or whose emotions and opinions have changed and impacts their personal policy in the days of today and what's going to happen once they're in office. We don't want to idealize sympathy when it detracts from tangible change in the present day. When we look at this, we see that politics are more focused on people than policy. That is a worldwide trend that has begun to detract from the ability for political institutions to provide information on what is going to happen when we elect people. That's what happened in the 2016 election, and it's all personality politics now because we have so many candidates who would rather find their supporters through emotion than what's happening. What we see is the formation of political cliques, like the Yang Gang, because it's cool to join up even though I guarantee you the majority of his supporters don't know anything about his policy past his UBI. It's so important that we look at this debate as regret of the movement towards preferring the person and what they have experienced over the events that they will cause to happen in the present day. We do not get grip of the... We do not get the peripheral effect of a person hearing and understanding that policy if all that he was talking about what happened in the past. This creation of cliques realizes that we've lost focus on what happens when these people are elected.

So what do we say some of the deep harms of renting are? So first let me say, there's a sense of servitude inferiority that unfortunately comes with something that is so intrinsic to your identity that it's essential to your sense of self, being put under the control of someone else for no better reason than that they were born into money and privilege in most cases. We see that people who do not have money are forced to tie something fundamental to their identity, fundamental to their life, their home, and put it under the power of somebody else. So that just tells someone that things which important to them and their identity can be controlled by someone else. They don't have full control over things that they care about.

Typically, the people you see are privileged people who were born in the United States, who are American citizens, never had to migrate in search of a better life, talking abstractly about things they don't really have a personal understanding of. The people who are excluded from the debate, the actual people suffering from separation at the border have two important characteristics. Firstly, they bring the most important unique perspectives to the debate. We say that they are the people who are able to share stories that aren't necessarily found by the media that aren't necessarily found by independent investigators. They are able to share personal experiences that no one else has access to. Secondly, we say they're the most important, motivated advocates in order to solve this problem. They're never going to give up to solve a problem that deeply personally affects them and their quality of life. Where someone for whom that problem is merely academic may be willing to just give that up. Thirdly, we say they are the most effective communicators to motivate public change on this issue. Why is that the case? Because we say that they are able to use their emotions, which are a universal language that all human beings share to share the depth of the severity of their experience with others. Even if you come from a wealthy background and you've never suffered from political oppression, you can still understand what it feels like to be bullied or to be ashamed of some aspects as well, and we think this gives people who come from privileged backgrounds a greater capacity for political action and ability to empathize with people who are truly suffering from political oppression. 
This makes it easier for people from these backgrounds where they are oppressed, where they do suffer, to get society as a whole to mobilize on their behalf instead of only trying to make change themselves as minorities that are already disempowered. These three characteristics, we think, make it absolutely essential that people who may not necessarily be able to stay calm in a debate be part of that debate.

Understand that political systems act on mandates from the public, the political system responds to demands on it that are made by the public. We say that without anger, it's far more difficult to get action on issues that matter to people and it is particularly more difficult to get urgent action.
We say firstly, that minority groups who face disproportionate disadvantages due to their smaller sizes and a greater political disempowerment and lower political influence, need the use of strong emotions to break through the barrier of apathy that many of the general public feel about things that don't impact them. They need to be able to share with people emotions that they can relate to in order to break down the sense that something is not a personal issue to someone. When you relate an issue to personal feelings that someone has, maybe about other things in their past, then you're able to make that issue somewhat personal to them. You can make the separation of children deeply personal to someone even who's just experienced the frustration and anxiety like losing their children in the mall for a few hours. Obviously it's not emotion to the same depth, it's not the same kind of pain, but they can at least relate to the fact that's a painful, difficult experience and they can see that had they been born in someone else's shoes, it could have been them.

You can twist it and use logic to come up with almost anything, but it's very difficult to emotionally justify why it is acceptable to separate children from their parents.
We stated the use of emotional motivators, of saying if something is deeply affecting you personally, it needs to change immediately, can break through gridlock that doesn't allow urgent action to be taken. We say this urgent action is absolutely necessary to make sure that real, immediate human suffering is resolved and more abstract issues like the financial problems of pension plans can maybe be dealt with in a calm way at a later date because they don't have the same kind of urgency associated with them.",constructive3,,rowanley,round3,rowanley_round3,1.0,79.0

So what this means then is that... I think that it isn't not for us to prove to you why it's the case that specifically tell your kid in a comparative way that they all be different from others around them, because they are inherently special means that you're able to feel suppressive and push them into marginalized ideals of role fulfillment on the basis of what you as a parent believe.It means that you as a parent are able to project bias mindsets that you might have, when otherwise, if you just push forth to your kid this mindset that they could fulfill things but you don't prepare what they can fill to what other people can fulfill. We think it means it's more open for your kid to interpret what you can do but also means that your kid can draw off of what other parents tell their children they can do.

How to write, how to engage in certain patterns of thoughts. When you fall behind in those developments, when you feel that you have difficulty reading in earlier grades, then you come to believe that you are bad at school and you have difficulty learning, and when you believe that you are not good at those things, there comes to be a cycle of self-validation where you believe you are not good at it, so you come to become worse at it. That does not happen in communities where children have more care applied to them because then, the narrative in poor communities is that a large amount of people are just not good enough and they are not made for this. They're not born for this, but in communities with the actual ability to afford that care, they are told that falling behind is not their faults and all they have to do is spend more time and have people spend more care upon them to actually catch up. While in poor communities, they are told that they cannot catch up because that's not who they are. We think that's a tragedy that can be fixed when we find things better and are able to provide better care.

This results in children like white girls trying to fight back against affirmative action because they feel as though minorities don't deserve those spaces and because they're inherently special. And when this happens with minority kids we tell you that there isn't any socially nuanced version. If you're telling minority kids that they are inherently special, this results in children generally being unaccepting of failure, which results in society trivializing the legitimate concerns that minority kids have. What does this result in? This results in perhaps a black girl who gets an F in her class thinking that I don't deserve to get this F because I am inherently special. But when she faces legitimate discrimination and she says, I don't deserve to be discriminated against, we think that those concerns are going to be conflated in a world of specialty. We think that it becomes easier to trivialize minority concerns on that point because children are generally made to feel they're inherently special. So whenever they're confronted with failure, they don't think that they deserve that failure. Therefore, when we have genuine concerns with regard to discrimination, it is easy to dismiss them because of the concerns that they raised which weren't genuine.",constructive3,4.0,saniairfan,round6,saniairfan_round6,1.0,77.0

But the reality is that when a norm of talking in terms of objective facts exists, it's used as a cudgel. It's used to punish people who don't conform to that norm. It's used when someone steps forward and says, this is my emotion. This is my experience. People don't listen to them. They say, no, we have an idea how political debate [log] function. You are not conforming to that Be more objective, be more rational. Site these statistics that we have. It is used to punish people who do not debate in the way that you deem appropriate and to exclude people. Yes, most people simply aren't engaged enough in politics to know who Jordan Peterson is. The comparidness debate is whether or not they use their limited amount of engagement to watch Fox news and Trump or check out back checking website on your Maybe you let minorities express more anger but they get crowded house a wholesale at a simultaneous empowerment of right-wing demagogues. I'm like, fuck. I just like, one... Let's not encourage. People are watching Fox news on either side of the house and they probably feel alienated from this norm of objectivity. Second of all, I'm laying out asymmetry, right? You punish people who don't have the statistics to engage in the battle you want them to engage with. By the contrast, would we validate the idea of emotion, we actually get better statistics. It's synergistic rather than competitive, right? Because when we validate the idea that it's right for you to care about this thing, we might watch you research that thing and develop more statistics about it to understand why you care about the thing. So we have more statistics to engage in the type of statistics-based discourse that they want. I think these arguments are a prerequisite of how do you people engage in political debates in the first case. And that matters more than what actually happens in the debate because you only made true type of error. And you have a lot of people in the debate.

For opening opposition says you need less harmony, more compromise, and people can't compromise when they have different emotional ideas. So I just think that they are not thinking about the right and the left in a useful way. I do not think it is useful to think about the right as entirely diluted or their emotion as entirely fake. The right's emotion is real. Maybe they shouldn't feel that emotion, but they do. So what happens when a right-wing person feels an emotion that I, as a left-wing person, don't feel? I ask why rather than just dismissing them as, oh your statistics are wrong because you don't understand how Bayesian probability works. I ask why they feel that emotion. That's how we deal with populism. By the way, they're populous arguments, incredibly lazy. My least favorite argument and debate is this: populism bad, Ooh! I hate it. So look, I would [pause] it that it needs to be empathy, but that the way we deal with these political trends is by seeking to understand them. Notice that this norm exists in the status quo and populism is flourishing in the status quo. Why? Because when you promulgated a norm of objective discourse, you say, oh the SPD and CSU agree on all these things. People who don't agree with that feel alienated and turn to populism. That's exactly why the alternative for Germany has flourished. Seeking to understand people across the aisle because you recognize there is something that that person cares about and you ask, why they care about that thing. And you can't simply dismiss them as being wrong or having the wrong statistics. That's when the coalitioning happens. That's when you share people's values and that's when people don't turn to populism because they feel alienated by a norm of objective discourse that is promulgated by a defect that never served them.

The second claim I'm going to today is that minority religious communities tend to be a bigger political constituency and sub national units than they are at the national level because they tend to be concentrated in a particular area. So for example, a minority of Muslim community is more of a constituency in the Southern area of Thailand than it is in the Northern area of timeline. Right. So at that point, we think that these governments that are closer to these communities probably had more incentive not to make policy that reflects the dominant, prevailing religious or cultural attitudes within their country to the exclusion minorities because those minorities aren't more important part of their political constituency. At a more local level. The third thing to say is that people are generally more connected to governments of the local level. It is easier to know who represents you. It is generally easier to participate in the process and stay informed about the process. You feel more connection to it in real life. And that means that you generally have more ability to have a say. We broadly think that the process and ensuring what religious Liberty looks like is more democratic. I just saw national level and the fourth thing to say is that cultural divisions about what religious Liberty looks like are often some of the premise of these sub national divisions, right? So we think one of the premises of combat being a division that is separate from the rest of Canada is this French heritage and this idea of Lacy PEI. So the fact that it is split apart in this way, easy part, competent to the fact that they have different cultural values to some extent that reflects different notions of what religious freedom should be. So I think that those are reasons that, look, we can take examples of the federal government doing this badly and sub national governments doing this badly or the federal government doing as well and some national governance doing this well.",constructive1,4.0,sgreenberg,round5,sgreenberg_round5,1.0,82.0
1572,"Second thing I'm going to talk about though, when we do need to bring some national units into compliance, what's the best way of doing this? Look what happens when you provide the funding? We agree that things like welfare are often very centralized and often these services are highly integrated, so that means that when you come off this funding, you'll hurt people, hurt people who didn't consent into these religiously violated policies. In fact, you are most likely are perky religious minorities that they care the most about protecting both because the government has any of that province or state has an incentive to shift the cost onto those communities and because they're likely to be marginalized or vulnerable in those, in those sub national units for other reasons. But second, you explain the cultural reasons why people care about their different policies, right? So provincial politicians in Quebec, for example, can now rail against the federal government and indeed minority religious communities. In the worst case, this could lead just a session referenda. And can you imagine the result of the succession referenda predicated explicitly on this idea of being oppositional is going minority religion within the sub national unit? I think that would be a terrible result. I think this is a policy that hurts people. I don't think they can be so live when they say, well, it's going to work because people are going to default to their economic interests. Look, people are willing to pay enormous costs for things that they culturally care about. What's a better method? So we would propose specific and targeted legal challenges that particular politicians. We think that's something that affects people's voting behavior, but isn't perceived as a general attack upon that sub region or the culture of that sub region. Also thinking a legal sentence, something that generates case law, which provides a longterm basis for political and legal mobilization against infringements of religious rights that we broadly think are bad rather than a one time contingent transactional threat from the government.

1711,"First, why it is broadly good to believe that you are special as a child. The first thing that we would say is that, this idea encourages exploration. I think that when you have this idea you have abilities, that you have potential, you're, one, less afraid to try things for fear of failure. And, two, you are more motivated to find something that you are particularly good at, to find something that lets you tap into that specialness, that lets you tap into that sense of destiny. We think it's just good, in a practical sense, that is to say it gives children a leg up. They get a variety of experiences that they can parlay things later in life. But we also think it gives them early experience in discovering some identity, some sense of who they are. Because it's important to try things and not like those things. It's important to try on different roles as a child and reject some of those roles, and learn how to grow and change as a person with different things that you do over time. That's how children gain that confidence to explore who they are, and that includes interpersonal confidence. I didn't play with other children at recess until third grade because I was afraid of them. I think that the idea that children bring something special, that they are valuable in and of themselves, makes them more confident to engage with other children as well. It makes them more able to engage in those social situations and find out who they are.",constructive1,5.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1712,"The second thing I would claim is that, it encourages them to be devoted to particular things. Because when you have this idea of potential, you want to fulfill that potential, so you want to spend time practicing whatever it is that you care about. We think that's good, in that it teaches you certain skills. It teaches you the value of perseverance. It teaches you hard work. We also think it is good, in that in the absence of you being intrinsically motivated, we think your parents might be likely to push you in ways that might not be desirable. Because your parents still want you to succeed and be exceptional. But we think a better, on the comparative, way to motivate that is by inculcating in the children some sense that their work will pay off because there is something special about them, rather than having to push them in ways that might strain that relationship.",constructive2,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1713,"The third claim that I'd make about why it's good to believe you're special as a child, is that it sets a certain moral standard. It sets an expectation of how you will act in the world. And the idea being that specialness is holistic, that is to say, you are special as an agent, as a person. And there is something about that specialness which means that you have some responsibility to act in such a way that is dignified and that befits your status. So, why do I think all of this really matters from the position of child? Because we think that people can and do develop more sophisticated moral systems later. The important thing as a child is that they have confidence, that they have the ability to learn basic social skills and to explore basic things about their identity, and to explore basic things about who they are. That's what allows them to develop more sophisticated moral systems later. Yeah.",constructive3,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1714,"Why do we think this matters? Because we think it is good, particularly for children who are minorities in some sense or disadvantaged in some sense, to learn at home to exercise their rights. We think that liberation is a process, and that is to say we think that it is important to be told in the home that you are valuable, that you are deserving of things just the same as anyone else. That you can be special just the same as anyone else. And we think that is the way that you learn how to practice demanding things that will make you more assertive and more able to exercise that identity later in life. I would note two additional implications of this arguments about what the world says. The first, is that some children will think they're special anyway because the world's going to tell them that because of their identity characteristics. So the harms of them thinking they're special in that way aren't unique. The second, is that [if off 00:00:05:13] is going to say it's really bad for children to feel special because they're going to step on all the other children. Note, that when their world from a very young age is competitive, when they're world from very young age is putting them into contact with other people who might be better at certain things, we think the messages at home serve a counterbalancing effect. That is to say, they will think that they are special in some senses and not in others because the world is telling them one thing and they're learning another thing at home. So, the impact of internalizing this message fully is mitigated to some extent. But, particularly the unique impact here is, people that wouldn't otherwise feel that someone is telling them that they're special. We think it's important that they get that at home.",constructive4,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1715,"Finally, I want to talk about what happens as you grow older and how you sort of take this concept of specialness with you, because they're going to say that, in time you've learned that maybe you aren't special in those particular ways. But I think that this concept of specialness is still valuable. The first is as a totem of your parents' love. It is important because it signals that you were special to them and you can be special to other people. You can be loved and you can be deserving of that choice, conferring a certain specialness upon you, because of some ineluctable quality of humanness that is within you. I think it allows you to have deeper relationships with your parents as you grow older, because it's one of the very early... It's an incredibly profound way that from a very early age, you know that you're special to them. But second, I think, in the longterm, you learn that everyone is special, because everyone is human and values different things and has a rich and subjective and irreducible quality of life. So maybe that isn't how you would understand specialness when you're an unnuanced child. But in time, when you get passed over for promotions or all of the other things that is going to tell you happen, you think about what your parents said and you realized they weren't entirely wrong. I am special. There is something about me that matters, because there is something about everyone that matters. That's how the concept of specialness grows with you and makes you a more complete moral person in the long term. Propose.",constructive5,5.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0

Because they can hire better tax accountants or they can do all of the other crazy stuff that rich people do when tax codes have a bajillion different independent taxes. There are different loopholes to get around them, and now we are adding one more. We think that this means that there is no reason that they will be selling the houses.

Also. So what does this mean? I think we give you examples. It means you under weigh people who aren't like you that is foreign policy decisions get a lot worse because you're never going to be interviewing this Yemeni child. You just drop a drone strike because you can't fully empathize with the subjective experiences. But you can empathize with subjective experience that people who are like the subject of terror attacks at home, it means you under weigh victims. That is to say you never listen to victims of sexual assaults because you always think, ""Oh that can't happen to me."" Or ""Oh, it's her fault for dressing slutty."" And you're a lot more likely to empathize with your white side and who could be falsely accused of rape. Even if the statistics say that only 1.5% of rape allegations are false, you always are never emphasizing with victims because you can never see yourself as being one of those victims. But we also think that Will tells you that there's a gender or racialized conception of who has the ownership of certain emotions.

Meaning when white woman accused a black man of rape, they have the monopoly on the sympathy emotion of being able to appeal to that. But when a black man or a black family is a victim of police brutality, they can't access these emotional appeals in the same way. And when you increase the magnitude of that subjectivity in discourse, people will always listen to the white female victim or like the white police officer who they are a lot easier to empathize with when things like objectivity, how many people are actually the subject of police brutality or like the fastest particular case are glossed over by the media.",constructive1,,srbaxi,round3,srbaxi_round3,1.0,79.0

He brings up the thing about like critical studies departments, but I think a great example of this is Brown V Board. That is to say you didn't desegregate schools because people didn't care or listen to black children who felt bad about having to go to segregated schools. The way you got school desegregation was when critical race departments presented research in the Supreme Court where kids who went to segregated schools thought black dolls were literally worse or uglier than white dolls.

There's already so much xenophobia and so much Islamophobia existing in societies today that we think that anything can do. The frames, these sorts of religious outliers in the United States as bad, it's probably going to be really bad for instances of hate crimes and instances of assault in these countries. We saw that anytime that Muslims or middle Eastern people are framed as being dangerous, whether it's by Trump or whether it's post 911 rhetoric, they tend to be attacked and that's really bad and the government, first and foremost, has an obligation to protect those people to the largest extent possible. We think that what this policy actually ends up doing, is mobilizing the types of religious zealots, who talk about the war on Christmas and other policies that the government puts out that they think makes it harder for them to be white and Christian.

One, the connection that you made from university to individuals from the class are necessary to succeed in the class. Two, there are industry requirements, I.e. if you want to be an elite in business, you have to have a certain business degree to be able to get your introductory job. And three, the degree themselves acts as some kind of a signal of your capability to be involved with the elite class. University is in fact the tipping point at which a low income individual is able to join an elite class in some sense. I.e. people who are low income individuals are able to go to Oxford, still become judges, lawyers and politicians. The people that are able to have large scale implements. This is the most important impact in the round. If we're able to take even a small number of low income individuals that otherwise wouldn't have gone to university and put them into positions of power as policymakers, legislators and judges, those are people that now have the background to understand the issues that low income individuals face. Those are the people that are most likely to advocate for increasing funding that goes towards early child education and post-secondary education for low income students. Those are people that are creating the longterm change that they're trying to fight for. This is most important impact from the round.
One additional piece we think is important to point out is that government money that goes towards universities isn't just going towards the direct education themselves. It also has important spillover effects into research that we think are really critical. Particularly in non-profitable areas of research, there's a public policy, education and psychology that don't happen to your business impacts and lead to poor profit funders not funding them. Research in these areas only happens, even at really elite universities, where there's sufficient outside funding to fray the cost of hiring the researchers, hiring the students as RAs and having enough of a classroom teaching environment that they have the other university resources to be able to have powerful research departments in the first place. Having this research is incredibly important, I.e. access to information has a really high value. ",constructive1,,thecactus,round2,thecactus_round2,1.0,80.0
1653,"First, three ways that ambitions are distorted in the status quo among young people. A lot of this applies to everybody, as well. The first is risk aversion. By default, most humans tend to be risk-averse. There has been substantial economic studies that people are more likely to try to avoid a possible harm than to seek a possible gain, even when the expected value of doing so would be lesser. But we think that by introducing a distorted view of the potential gains from hard work, you then account for that and shift the equilibrium towards one where people are working towards their expected value as a person. Secondarily, we think that people tend to remember fear more than they remember success. That is that if you have something very traumatic to you happen ... If you're up there at the top of a spelling bee and you can't remember how to spell the word cauliflower, third grade was rough. You remember that all the way until you're giving a speech at HWS. But if we can introduce some kinds of successes, they're less likely to stick with your memory. You forget your successes from a week ago and you're already focused on your problems. Third of all, we think that the incentives for competition, the other actors outside of the individual, can distort or deceive them. This is kind of what I mentioned in the opening about test-takers. There's often an incentive to make it seem as if you didn't work as hard as you do or to try to convince others that they're not worth as much as they are. Secondarily, we think it's really important to note that increased ambition actually does lead to increased success among young people. Two reasons. One, we think that in many domains, hard work is sufficient to achieve a certain amount of success. Even if somebody is super unathletic, if they spent enough time in the gym and enough time at practice because they believe they're special, the extra five or 10 hours that they're spending per week is going to be sufficient to make them at least moderately successful. I'm not saying they're going to be LeBron James, but they can achieve some success.

1654,"trying is always going to lead to more success on some level. It's possible there are diminishing marginal returns, and we're open to that, but more trying is never going to make you less successful in the vast majority of situations. Now, there's probably, we think, two categories of impacts to people being higher ambition. The first are external impacts, the way the people being more ambitious help people besides them. The main idea here is we think that when you make people more ambitious, they're more likely to make meaningful contributions in various career paths, particularly in areas in which the probability of being successful in a given field is so low that it would be irrational for any individual to think, without some kind of distortion, that they would be able to contribute to that kind of a field. We think that these types of outside narratives are actually oftentimes a prerequisite to be able to achieve that kind of progress. Imagine entrepreneurs, for example, where the percent chance for the start-up succeeds is oftentimes less than 10%, depending on the region. The percent chance that your idea was actually valuable was even lower, and even if you think that your idea is good, there are plenty of statistics available, but the vast majority of people who think that their ideas are good actually don't have good ideas. This is where we think the parents can play a moderating effect. We think it makes it more likely, then, that we have people that go into ambitious scientific fields to tackle problems that we consider to be intractable in the status quo. This, we think, is the tipping point of where somebody who is already going to be a scientist decides to try to solve some form of cancer, rather than trying to find some kind of niche area that's not going to impact that many people but might be easier to solve. We think this is the difference between somebody who would otherwise go and start a small business in their town, instead trying to start a large social movement or start a large entrepreneurial business. All of these things, we think, are hard to quantify the exact impacts of, since they're so diverse, but are likely to have substantial positive spillover effects.",constructive2,5.0,thecactus,round6,thecactus_round6,1.0,79.0
1655,"But secondarily, we think that this also has a radically positive impact internally for the students. For one, we think that people are always going to be happy from success. We think that people are oftentimes going to be sad for failure, but the key difference here, we think, is that people were also sad from the lack of trying something. We think this is why you probably prefer [Doug 00:06:14] [Bench 00:06:14] on this issue. That is, if you never actually try something when you're 40, I think that's when you have a mid-life crisis and realize you haven't really done anything with your life. I think that's likely to be a more sustainable kind of this happiness than the other types that we see. But this also gets more pernicious as you move outside of the general population or outside of everybody possibly affected. Two groups, we think, are of particular interest. One, we think that minorities are likely to have disproportionately distorted beliefs about what they're able to achieve. So any of the impacts we've talked about, how other people were having their views moderated, are likely to be exponentially more important for minorities. We think that a similar process applies for those who have learning impairments or those who are differently-abled, because they're no longer able, in many cases, to meet societal expectations of what society would say constitutes success or being special. And therefore, oftentimes the only meaningful indicator that they're able to achieve of personal success and happiness comes from others in their life who tell them they succeeded, even when the rest of the society doesn't. And we think that is the role that parents play.",constructive3,5.0,thecactus,round6,thecactus_round6,1.0,79.0

We think that's a big example where we think that you need to understand that sharing is a big part, especially like building up this community. But second of all recognizing the harsh nature of the world. So this long-term impact of like learning the importance of hard work, is essentially saying that you're not guaranteed everything in life. You're not always guaranteed a promotion, no matter how hard you work. We say then, that it's much more important to realize that there's still something to life outside of all of these achievements that you're going to get. Right? So we think on our side of government, what it looks like is that if you're inherently special, then you're inherently deserve these achievements. We think that you're tying a lot of your self worth to achievement itself. We think that on our side of the house, that recognizing the harsh nature of the world, especially for some minority communities who are systematically oppressed, and who don't have the same, can't afford the same type of things that other, like white males can, for example. So for young children, like the bad black community for example, need to understand that there's a harsh nature of the world, and that's why they have to act differently. We don't think that this is fair at all, and we don't think that this is... But it's necessary for them to understand that they're not inherently given the same rights that other people are. We think that's unfortunate, and that's something that needs to change, but it's important to recognize the harsh nature of the world, where you're not inherently special. We think that it looks like when a boss tells you that you haven't been, you didn't do a good job, and that's why you're getting fired. We think that it's a lot easier to cope with that, if you start coping with that earlier on.

Because given that they have limited resources, that means they also have limited resources to give children medical care, limited resources to get parents to spend more time with their children. And those limited resources means that the impacts of this debate are entirely mitigated. But that's when you need to weigh the cost and benefits, we think the post-secondary degrees they say are more expensive, first we say comprehensive childcare and comprehensive, like, national childcare, comprehensive medical care for children is very expensive, if you want to take care of every single child of that lower income bracket. But secondly, trade school is far less expensive, even if they have to be subjected to a slightly less expensive form of post-secondary education. At least there's a higher likelihood that their children and their grandchildren are likely to climb up the social ladder, which you don't get on their side of the house when they just give zero to five education.

The origin out of the wealth tax, very much in the spirit of someone like, say, Elizabeth Warren, that we are creating, is a meaningful competition against the monopoly that certain areas have on housing units. Therefore, they cannot charge rents above that of the marginal production cost, which incidentally there is no device construction cost. It's just inaccurate. That competition drives the rents. Thirdly, the assumption zoning laws as a fixed is totally wrong. It's not exogenous, it is endogenous. Zoning laws changed why? Who supports zoning laws right now? Homeowners, because restricted zoning laws people of color, and poor people from entering neighborhoods, because they provide competition to their own house unit, therefore lowering the value of their property. The only people who oppose zoning laws right now are the homeowners themselves. Renters hate zoning laws because it rises and increases their rents. So millions of upper middle class and middle class people change from the homeowning market to the rental market.

1408,"Second part of our extension: home ownership culture undermines aggregate growth and fuels financial crisis. Financial... Our first part of this, our financial bubbles for widened relations in Singapore global housing bubble that occurred in 2000 and 2007. There are three reasons why home ownership is a terrible savings vehicle that is not identified by the opening government. Number one, they are undiversified assets. If I'm going to spend $250,000 in a financial asset, I put it in multiple different kinds of undiversified, hopefully uncorrelated, different assets as insurance against fraud. You know what housing isn't? It's undiversified. It's all your units in one financial asset. If it falls, all your savings: totally gone. Number two, it's highly illiquid. The reason why rich people tend to prefer putting their savings in T-Bills certificates to the index funds is if you need to come up with cash relatively fast, you can sell them pretty fast and you'd get cash relatively fast. But the thing is, you'll see brokers large amount of time to sell your home and extract the equity, or you'll see brokers and financial managers take 25% each. The implicit response we get is that, while owning a home is a super easy way in which you can access capital, not true. There are hundreds of pages of legal documents and the fees from is enormously complicated. In contrast, wanted to get a treasury bill from, say, Royal Bank of Canada or, say, the Federal Reserve, it's incredibly easy. I can whip out my phone and do so. Other forms and includes certificates of deposits, which are incredibly safe but low rates of return, that actually are better than housing, or you could just invest in an index fund with ten times the rate of housing, particularly if you compared it over the long term.

1409,"And back to your argument: about people primarily accessing lines of credit through extracting housing equity is housing bubble. It is all your money, not only the money you put into the housing and additional loans are all coming out of the housing unit. If the value of that home ever falls, I don't know because of relative or any calculation of market, you've lost everything. We just the bottom 80% of the population in the United States has still not recovered since 2008. You create financial crisis. 

Why does this outweigh everything else? One, financial crises are far worse to destroying nest eggs than in the importance to switch from a homeownership to rental units. Two, financial crises typically harbor richer insurance, they could take advantage to make back their money, whereas financial crisis generally income has still not recovered.

The problem is there's this to entries such as requiring a Bachelors degree to run a private daycare by which you can do so or people spending a lot of money because they want really high quality at a high tier early childhood education but with very little evidence by which it works. Fourthly, public funding has robust trade offs, with private provision of services.

That is, they can effectively say there's no reason or issue to take 6 months off, or no reason why you need to work irregular or fewer hours if they're just a publicly funded facility, by which you can do so.

Firstly, there is no meaningful substitute for accreditation, that is, even if you learn absolutely nothing in college which may be true for certain degrees, there's important stipulating values that exist for requiring a post secondary education degree. That is, they need to finish the degree to signal to employers that you are a capable employee. That you can finish school with decent grades and work hard. If you do not have that degree, it is very, very difficult to earn their market value. It suggests that the return investment from getting a college degree, is over the lifespan well over a million dollars. Secondly, they determine the elite within society. There's huge evidence of a large return in investment, and those who graduate from universities tend to be those who had a fast track towards the degrees by which society, of course respects. And there is no meaningful alternative that you can get at a lower provision of services. Unless you attend the certain subset university of accredited universities by which you do so. There is pre-requisite of making sure that your child gets a good education. Thirdly, there's strong evidence that high parental education improves their child's lives. So you want to improve the kind of quality education Prime Minister talks about, there is no substituting for doing so. Importantly, there is strong evidence that additional public funding can push people through school. There is strong evidence to suggest that if people have a few more dollars, then things like textbooks, making rent or etc, that push people to drop out of school, therefore forfeit the millions of dollars of return investment they get in education, can be effectively enumerated by additional dollars provided by the government. This does not price up prices, because there's meaningful competition particularly outside in the upper tier schools that meaningfully differentiate prize. Within the overwhelming majority of people who come from relatively larger schools, there's meaningful competition and therefore, few additional dollars and a large bang for their buck to making sure that people get access to what is quite literally a ticket to the meal of life.

One, subjectivity puts the onus on those who suffer to come forward as a mechanism to legitimize their claim. This is distinct from the argument makes about lived experiences are responded to, because this argument says even if they're not responding, it's still to put themselves in the spotlight if they want to gain any legitimate credence. Therefore, the people who come forward are those least likely to suffer the most because they're the ones who face the fewest consequences from legitimately coming forward, thereby meaning that the people whose lived experiences actually make it in front of the television camera are least likely to be those who support social justice ends.",constructive1,,williamarnesen,round3,williamarnesen_round3,1.0,77.0

We've ever by deepen and distinguish our argument in two distinct ways.

If you're from closing government, even if emotion is subjective, experience is considered acceptable, it is not likely to be considered uniformly acceptable and legitimize. Women's anger is often seen as illegitimate and even if you were allowed to introduce an anger or other emotions into political discourse, it's not likely those anger will be seen as legitimate anger. Which means the kind of anger that will be seen as socially acceptable is more likely to be the kind of anger weaponized by people like Donald Trump when he reels against certain groups, then it has to be likely to be other kinds of groups. We know, for example, from debate, the white male voices are consistently privileged when it comes to making ordinances. This is the group that we should care about the most. The best tool that non privileged groups have is emotional numbers and evidence such that even if there was some privileged, the strength of their evidence is irrefutable.

But I see X palsy group ruined my life and represents a war on my ethnolinguistic group or et cetera.

This is why demagogues love arguments about emotion whipping up the fury of the crowd, and liberal groups, or social justice Jews are far more likely to use things, like say facts to say this policy actually screws over majority people. But secondly, most importantly, it rationalizes the suspension of rights because people natural incentive is to select the most extreme lived experiences by which you showcase, which raises the states of political discourse to such an extent that traditional groups of rules of engagement seem untenable. That is when mistakes are this is how it ruined my life versus this affected, say, $500 in income across the country on aggregate. These stakes of political becomes so much higher than you see polarization. You see breakdown with democratic norms, particularly in developing countries. I think this debate is largely ignored. Subjectivity and discourse occurs right now. It's frequently tool used by demagogues.

We think because there is a long lag by which you can... if they are not inclined which you go through the court again to enforce it, 15-year lag after Brown v. Board by which they started to do anything in the American South to enforce it. There needs to exist strong, automatic mechanisms which the federal government enforces these things. Recognize that the executive will not exercise discretionary power to enforce things like Eisenhower did in the Little Rock Nine in 1955, if they're reliant on that state governors, for example, or state legislature for political support, so there is the necessity that they require automatic checks by which to do so. No, thank you. One is it then that protecting religious liberty is so important. One is because religion is an essential way by which we find truth. It is very difficult to understand the world for millions and millions of people without some conception of where our value set is, what life is, exist beyond this individual life, and what we should say what is the good life and how we should live. The belief that if you are acting contrary to the index of your religion could result in eternal damnation makes us not just a minor component of that can be legislated away, but a critical component about the way with which people perceive the world. If anything, I will consider the right to religious liberty to be equivalent as a right to almost any other form or right that exists within the Constitution. Therefore, it is not a right that can be simply waived away in a balancing test and must require that it needs to be over-exuberant enforcement.  In fact, if you're willing to overshoot in protection of liberty if necessary to do so because we imagine opening opposition will cite a few court cases that maybe went to far. One, it's because taking away liberty is hard to give that liberty back then once you have already taken it away, and secondly, the harms of under regulation are small compared to the huge concentrated effects of losses to those deeper numbers, so even if this results in over-exuberant enforcement of religious liberty, that is a bullet we are willing to bite.",constructive1,5.0,williamarnesen,round5,williamarnesen_round5,1.0,83.0

Secondly, meters can not be trusted to exercise discretionary power to enforce court rules because lack the incentive to appeal to majority religiosity as seen most of the US Republican Party.

This is in fact a feature, not a bug-... no thank you. Took one earlier... by which we can enforce these clauses. Second part of substantive, you need religious leaders to have faith in government institutions and is preserved. The reason religious organizations are so active in politics is they fear that if their preferred candidate does not win, the government is going to trample on their rights. The reason why we need powerful laws that enforce religious liberty laws is providing meaningful sets of securities as even though a Democrat wins or even though the Liberal Party wins in Canada, that their protections and their way of life is secure.  We think, for example, allowing private religious schools mean that religious groups are less likely to allow you to roll back sex education or birth control in every school secure in knowing that if that ever happened, they could always go to the private religious schools. It is important that you fight extraordinarily powerful protections, particularly in places where churches are strong like in Mexico or much of America to make sure that these religious leaders do not use their enormous power to weaponize and mobilize huge swaths of the population to affect, say, the rights of everyone else. You need strong religious protections to make sure that they feel secure that their way of life is secure and do not use that to try to affect the way of life of everyone.

This is the difference that we have for the metric of evaluation. This bar is able to be met easier on our side of the house because it is innate to them. But on their side of the house, it means you have something constantly you need to strive for in order to achieve. We'd say that being exceptional is something additional in terms of achieving happiness, as opposed to the base level we're able to receive from our parents telling us of why they value us. Not because of our performance. It puts us in a double bind of saying we gain happiness internally and from our parents if we succeed. And if we fail, we get nothing. On our side, at least we get the love of our parents. But secondly, I think parents are inflating their expectations of children and that sets a bar for happiness that is difficult and often impossible to attain. That's for two reasons. First is a talent distribution. It gets unrefuted by them, and second is the idea of structural barriers that exist. It means that children aren't always going to live up to be exceptional among their peers. This is still true for rich kids who aren't able to necessarily compete with kids at their private school and are going to be comparing themselves in that context and are able to become exceptional because their parents have even higher expectations of them than other parents may have of their different children. Right? I would say that generally this means that no kids get to actually achieve this generally or it's very hard for them to, because of the affirmation reasons I gave you.

It feels like just like an average job and never really gets to that level of where it feels special, but maybe he would have been a fantastic pianist. The world will never know because he said he was special and he's playing baseball for the rest of his life. Second is learning from peers. It unlikely you have that nuanced narrative on their to the house where they go, well, this is my special thing, but that guy I can learn from him because he sure is special in his thing. Well that's far more likely to be on our side of the case. When you tell people that they're all innately special, all have some kind of intrinsic value. It means you don't learn from the peers around you. But third, is that you're unlikely to get self-improvement because Omar tells you to blame society every time you fall, because if you don't succeed that are letting you down. If you don't succeed, then it is society's fault. At what point do you call for introspection and identification of personal flaws when the idea is that if I'm not capable of this, then therefore society must be wrong. There's no principle to guide this issue if there's no actual working to change yourself.

Later on to say, well maybe this is where I could self improve.

1440,"want them to. They aren't going to comprehend these things that opening Well, where are these things you're important to? We just think that the moment at which your child ask whether or not they're special, is not the moment to have this conversation. Instead,, we think you tell that kid, ""Yes. They are special. Yes. They can do anything."", and perhaps then, with their great boost they had, rather than idling around and doing nothing with their lives, using their privilege to help nobody, they use that belief they are special and that power and that aging and do something. They will actually step out from the shadow of their privileged parents. They'll actually do something important with their lives. So I think it's actually uniquely rewarded in the case of privileged children, if you do tell them they are special. Because if you don't tell them they're special then why would they ever try to do anything with everything just handed to them on a silver platter. We tell you that telling children that they have a unique, intrinsic sense of worth allows them to break out of that mentality that come up from being in a privileged household. Secondly, we tell you that all this business about children shouldn't understand the truth of it... I think what they really make is the first dichotomy here because you can tell a child they're special and then not spoil them with gifts and then you can not... You can make sure they do choirs around the house even though you could easily afford for them not to do that. The fact is, there are many ways that you can teach your kids to work harder and still them they're special. Those things are not mutually exclusive and I think in our world telling a kid they're special but also have them do some chores around the house... Those things are very plausible and kids understand your encouragement and have them do things. This is a clear pathway for privileged children to both, believe they're special and not have the mental view that they should do something of worth with their lives and use their privilege for good and at the same time, they don't have an inflated sense of their own worth.

Recognize, in their situations, I've already gone into it already to some extent, there is a very real risk that children just become desolate. They're going to feel like from a very young age they don't have the same advantages as others. This is already a huge structure in their lives because they can see everyone around them doesn't have the same advantages as they do. Parents have an obligation to check back against that by building up the internal self-esteem and self-worth of that child at a really early age. So then, eventually, they do find out that the world isn't quite as good as they believe. They have the resilience to withstand and keep working hard anyway. If you look at people who have fought really hard against oppression in the past, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela. Those people did face inhuman dignity to not give up. Mandela spent 27 years in prison and he would never have had the backbone to do that if he had not believed he had the power to stand up for himself because he was special he worked ha",constructive2,3.0,alexnielsen,round6,alexnielsen_round6,0.0,73.0
1466," So onto rebuilding of Mefreger's points. So the reality of an individualist society and where we live, and what it means to teach a child they are special within a society. So we live in a world where individual ideas and successes are the most rewarded, and thus the narrative that your child is special will help them in developing skills and ideas that are rewarded in our society. So if you tell your child that their abilities are inherently special and better than other people around them, then that means that they have an edge where they understand that they are deserving of this success. They will seek out that success and they will seek to improve those abilities to a point where they become the most special, because they believe that they are. And we think that on an individual level, this leads to the belief that you are deserving of success and thus will seek it out. When we teach children to look out for number one in a society which only, no, the only person you can look out for in our world is yourself, then we're setting them up for success and we're setting them up to be successful in a world where this is the only important thing where your personal successes and your personal rewards come from your hard work and your faults. So we tell you this, why is this important? So why do we want to teach children that they are special within this world? And why do we see that as being more important than something that may bring up saying that they just have value. So what we see when we tell children that they are special is that they have an idea of what they have to offer society that they can then apply in their lives, and that they can gain successes from.

1467,"And the main point I want to talk about today is the impact on women and young girls, which I think Naya characterized very well and which was untouched by OO. So, no thank you. So when parents treat their daughters like they're special and to achieve great things, then you're equipping young women with the knowledge that they have inherent value, which unfortunately under the status quo doesn't happen. We don't teach young women on a standard level that they have inherent special qualities that are different and better than the people around them. So what happens on our side of the house when you teach young girls that they have qualities that are special, that are different, that are important, is you get women more inclined to want to take on leadership positions. When you tell a young girl that she's special and thus deserving of the success of a leadership position, then she's going to want to achieve that better, she's going to want to take on that position. When we tell girls that they're special we empower them to become leaders, and why is this point so important on our side? So what we see under the status quo is, when we don't think of individuality when it comes to what children are taught, as they're socialized, when they grow up, when we don't have a standard level of teaching each child that they're special as they grow up, we don't get the same benefits when we see young women as leaders and necessary. And on the impact of young girls who are systemically undervalued in our current society when it comes to socialization as children, that if they were to receive indications from their parents that they have inherent special and unique qualities that are valuable to society, they could potentially seek out leadership positions from a younger age.

We have to recognize that Israel is probably the only actor in the region who can unify both Shia and Sunni interests against a common enemy in this specific scenario. This means that by having a hard line against Israel, Russia has a chance now to buy out more allies, open the Shia faction and the Sunni faction in the Middle Eastern region.

I think this is where the first clash of how this has come to be the status quo. I think in the status quo, parents are kind of torn if they should be realistic or be honest with their child. If they know their child lives in an impoverished area and probably can't ask the same resources that a white child could in a very nice neighborhood, they might not want to set you up for disappointment.

This means that if a parent makes this snap decision when they're raising a child, that the child is not going to be able to achieve much because of the area they live in, or the context they're growing up in. It means that the parents want to offer, like provide messaging, that the child's going to then grow up understanding that they probably can't achieve as much, right? I think that that's harmful and that when we shift this on the comparative to look more like a world in which parents are saying, ""No, you are special, you should you do whatever,"" it changes.

With that said, that's a bit of framing. I want to get on to two points of extension with integrated rebuttal. The first one, how this is going to use largely as a tool for dominant religions and the second on the cost to the state when this is imposed. So first, on to how this is a tool for dominant religions. Remember there are a lot of religious liberties that come at the expense of other people, for example, religious schools refusing to employ gay people, which is an issue that has come up in the United States and other developed countries, right? All the time. It is theoretically a religious liberty that a Catholic school should be, should be able to refuse employ to someone who does not align within their stated religious values. But that does not mean that that religious liberty is The specific problem is that there are religious liberties for which there was no trade off. For example, your ability to go to a church and pray, but there are other religious liberties where there's a trade off with another individual's rights. For example, the ability to, for example, the ability to deny baking a cake to a gay couple who wants to have a cake made for their wedding and that very famous case. It happened in the United States recently, but the fact is that that is not true. That religious liberties in every case don't have some other potential, right?",constructive1,3.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0
1840,"That is, that is being infringed on it because of those religious liberties. I think that they need to make the case for why religious liberties come before all other kinds of liberties that religious liberties could theoretically trade off with and not just that religious liberties are inherently good. Now, I think that there are a few specific examples of this. You can look at, for example, this Quebec law. I think it has a pretty reasonable defense in that, for example, the school teachers. Let's say there's a Muslim kid in that area and the school teacher and they live in a predominantly Christian area, and the school teacher wears a cross around their neck. That's a reminder that they're an outsider. What you want for federal employees is to, in a secular society, is for them to be able to appeal to all people around the... I'll get to you in a bit... To be able to appeal to all people of all backgrounds and not make some people feel stupider as opposed to others.",constructive2,3.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0

That like a, you know someone, a federal employee or a, someone wearing a hijab in Alabama, is going to be looked upon negatively already in the status quo. That's not true or that's true. That's true in either world. Even if this law is put in place, the difference is that all of a sudden that person, you know the like the Muslim kid who goes to school is going to see their teacher wearing specifically Christian iconography which is going to reflect negatively. Now the next thing I want to talk about is the issue... Is specifically you can look at this as being a big deal in developing countries, right? So like for Iran for example has a state system and in fact does have States and you can see for example that Tehran is much more liberal. The countryside. Well guess what?",constructive3,4.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0
1842,"We've actually don't get religious progress against these, this major religious dogma when religious liberties are propagated at the expense of other minority rights, like those of women or other stuff, minorities. Okay. And so now on to the final third point here, which is about the costs of the transition and the cost of states physically. We don't get a conceptualization of whether States are likely to accept or deny this from the opening government, but we think it's likely to happen is that States are likely to put up a fight. They are likely to say fine we won't take your federal funds and they're likely to just take a hard line because these are deep seated beliefs in these people. We don't think it's going to work in the long run, but we think they're likely to take this line and what's likely to happen is that these people, these areas are going to go into serious economic recession.",constructive4,4.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0

Their infrastructure deteriorates, the quality of life, their citizenry goes down. You don't have federal services provided to them and it gets much worse in the area. Now this is really problematic because remember, you're punishing the people, the citizens for bad decisions on the part of the government, right? And so this is really, this is, I think the first one was the principal here, because you should not punish the citizens for the actions of the government. And that if there's a chance of them not accepting this, that they are acting people facing the consequences are not those in power, they are actually the ones who are worse off, or the worst off in society.",constructive5,3.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0

Obviously the purpose of this isn't much of an aggressive principle, but it does mitigate the benefits. The reasons for this are pretty clear: first of all because in first classical systems you often times have wasted votes, there's often times two incredibly unpalatable options, it's often times the case that you are young or you were in prison because of a drug law and all these are just scenarios in which you are equally coerced.",constructive1,,chrispang123,round11,chrispang123_round11,0.0,

Because if you had those sorts of privilege, you are also likely to be the person that is tasked the most. And Gocci gives you a mechanism for this, which is, that is on authoritarian states. They have to be able to keep up some semblance of economic stability. That was critical and it was a mechanism that they do not engage with. Given that's the case then, you understand that on their side, it is oftentimes equally oppressive because not giving tax means that you would subsequently benefit from an equally oppressive system as well.",constructive2,,chrispang123,round11,chrispang123_round11,0.0,

Yes it's the case that, as we would say, some of us might go to bad stuff. But that contradicts their own reputation to us, because their reputation to us is that you were coerced into this. This person had a gun to your head. Well, if that's the case and you paid the person that had a gun to your head, that doesn't mean you're responsible for the actions that the person that had this gun to your head does afterwards, right? So, based off their old principal framing, it is unlikely to be true that you wouldn't necessarily responsible for the negligent act. But, even if that's the case, I think the fact that you are negligent, itself, is a principle. In that, less than 10% of this goes towards a genocide, and the other not in the best case scenario, and the other 90% of this goes toward social services that end up helping many people get lifted out that starvation was something that was less likely to happen.",constructive3,,chrispang123,round11,chrispang123_round11,0.0,

1210,"Why does this lead to an expansion of a general body of accepted ideas in a positive way and not a regressive way? Well, this happened in my POI. When I POI'd them, just on the basis of how minorities are facing structural oppression, advocate for their safety and advocate for their rights to be promoted. Usually it's on the basis of, ""My emotions are happening right now because police brutality induced trauma on me."" or because ""ICE knocked down my door."" These structural forms of oppression are harming my safety. Usually all of these bases are on the fact that we don't have equal access to human rights as other groups out there. I think is something distinctly different from a lot of the right-wing silent majority populism that comes out of them on the basis, because you realize that the delineation of the rights that they're advocating for aren't as clear cut as ""You're infringing on my safety."" Usually it's something along the lines of ""You're infringing on my traditional values. My country isn't the same way it looked for."" It's just not as hard hitting in the courts and especially what we value in a Western liberal Democracy. But granted, this obviously would give some leeway and marginal gains to maybe anti-abortion groups and are willing to concede that on OG, that this gives a little bit of a platform to regressive ideas. Just on the basis of the fact that we are probably adding a lot more people into the political discussion that are not getting equal access to their right to security in the first place, I think that those gains for those communities that are pushed out on the emotional basis, is far greater.",constructive1,,coreyd405,round3,coreyd405_round3,0.0,75.0

I think this looks like in the LGBTQ community, you're probably going to have wealthy, gay, white men advocating against police brutality rather than trans people. I think that this means even black lives matter. When you have someone stand up and speak about the experiences of police brutality they had, that's probably somebody that had marginally more resources than somebody in the same community to be able to want to advocate that. Why is this necessarily a bad thing? It's because it means the people who face the brunt of the oppression are never the ones on the forefront advocating for policy reform or policy change, meaning that the policy always gets whitewashed, always gets watered down, and it doesn't necessarily serve the most important urgent needs of this. We've seen this, about how the gay community prioritized gay marriage and they didn't even worry about workplace harassment and police brutality in a lot of cases.

This is where it gets interesting because these parents tell their children that they're special, that they're different from what society expects them to do, but moreover that they are special and they should achieve more than what we have done. That being said, these children are going to try to achieve more than their own parents. They're going to choose education when they face like this kind of trade off, because especially in impoverished areas, they often times have to choose between school or working early and leaving school and that is the point in which they're going to choose to go to school so they can succeed in the future because they're special.

Firstly, on the idea that everyone naturally has aspirations to do better, but naturally there are some mental blocks that come into form stereotypes, or ideas that they simply can't achieve enough because we currently live in a meritocratic society. Maybe because I failed my math exam, I'm not good at math, I shouldn't study at all. That is a kind of mindset that happens in a lot of areas right now, but what happens in our world in which the parents tell their children that they're special is they start to overcome this, right? You have to self actualization idea. That opening kind of describes it for you. But more than that, it's not just you as a person who is changing, right? Because presumably all of the parents in society are telling their children that they're special. So you have a collective of individuals who think that society is not good enough and that is why you actually mechanized these kind of grassroots movements that happen in society. Right?

I'm going to talk about feminism, so existing social pressures will tell you that, Oh, you should go into a certain career field, et cetera.

They're not constrained to the idea of success of what it means to be successful a woman. That is to say they can pursue their own fields that they want, they don't have to be a woman in STEM to be successful woman. hey can be a good artist, they can be a good musician if that makes them fulfilling. Because they're special, they don't have to see a succumb to all those other expectations for the second part of this is that they have the right and obligation to say no to things like sexual harassment, right?

Because we hear a lot about marginalization and how that impacts domestic politics, but the reality is, especially in Western liberal democracies, the place that marginalization and oppression and human rights abuses can be most impacted is through foreign policy. And because you can't easily empathize with people from those areas. We see often horrendous examples of human rights abuse being tolerated by people who otherwise are focused emotionally on other issues. So now moving on, the ability to empathize with people radically different from you is close to zero, right? You don't open the newspaper and understand at an emotional level what political oppression feels like in Saudi Arabia or in China. Why? Because in a Western liberal democracy or in places where there is a safe space to express yourself, you don't have that problem. We think there's a very interesting example in the example of why do we trade with Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi was killed at the Turkish embassy? More importantly, why did we even care about Khashoggi? We cared about Khashoggi because all the journalists in the press personally knew him and they were emotionally affected by his death, but that ignores the much larger human rights abuses that occurred in Saudi Arabia every single day and go ignored because people either can't empathize or don't have the bandwidth.",constructive1,,djasson,round3,djasson_round3,0.0,76.0

So therefore, even if you can empathize with everyone, you can't keep up and emotional aspects of debate wear off far quicker than logical reasoning. We think fragmentation of experience means that emotions go both ways. That means again, if you feel very strongly about marginalized people in your country emotionally, well someone can feel the exact same way and the other way and it's a wash. We think that fragmentation of experience is also why there's not enough action on issues like gun control or climate change because everyone has only small experiences that don't pull together to the big picture, that only data and reasoning can explain.",constructive2,,djasson,round3,djasson_round3,0.0,76.0

We think it's just true that there are institutional reasons why you might not be able to achieve your dreams, and that having that conscious and working around it is more important.

Secondly, there's that oftentimes having people's stories and lived experiences is a main way in which people, because they're rallying behind courses of action that actually needs to be changed. What this means is that in many circumstances, having an experience and a story of oppression, and having one individualized story which has happened, means that people remember what had happened, remember the viscerality of it all, are actually much more likely to advocate for it.

1528,"children more able to succeed more fulfilling that parental responsibilities. Let's get right into that, right? So what do children need to succeed? So I'll be telling you the critical piece of success in either sense of the word, like I kind of talked about at the top, is the belief that it comes from this sort of internal motivation, right? A belief in oneself that isn't actually shaken by failure, drawbacks. Sometimes things happen to all of us, just being people in the world, right? Internal motivation is essential because it's unwavering. It's not contingent on circumstance. It can withstand kind of things that happen to you that are negative, right? Obviously there will always be failure and things to deal with, particularly in the pursuit of one's goals, right? You're never just continually progressing towards something, there will always be drawbacks, and having belief within yourself that isn't impacted by those goals and fundamentally shaken allow you to actually kind of move forward with those things, right? It's also not contingent on other people and their motivations, right? I think parents are sort of unique in that they're really the only objective with you as a child just help you the best they possibly can, right? They're often, especially from your perception as this child, that's kind of all you see them as doing right. They're here to support and love you, right?  So lots of other people, other kind of external motivation children may get throughout their life. It's also often more difficult to see why they're giving you praise, right? Do they have their own motives, their own sort of circumstances as to why that's happening and so it's less sort of a meaningful, valuable thing that they were taken to impact your identity when you have that extra motivation. So essentially there's a lot of ways in which internal motivation it's kind of the only thing that could provide a solid belief in oneself. You should continue to do the thing, even if there are sort of, drawbacks and things that, not take that within yourself, right? So internal belief in oneself and one's goals is an essential piece of success because it gives you something to continually strive for. For you to keep going, working towards, right?

1529,"So when it's critical at this particular juncture to then impress upon them that, ""Yes, you are a special person, you have individual value,"" and therefore kind of like grow that internal motivation but then that I talked about, right? Also important to understand, that children haven't actually really had to face a lot of failure yet, right? Generally their lives are like pretty straight forward. There aren't major sort of obstacles standing in their way. There's a chance they can kind of build themselves up and it's a critical sense, but then when they go into the world and they no longer have the sort of constant reassurance with their parents, they have this fundamental belief in themselves that allows them to weather those other obstacles.  So why does this mean children are more likely to succeed, right? So come back to this idea of the two forms of success. So why being valid in your identity, feeling like you're a unique individual is an inherent form of success, we think, right? Just generally feeling like you have a purpose as a human. There's some reason why you're not just like another face in the crowd. There's not just the meaningless void. You as an individual have some sort of value, right? I think that's a form of success and this motion obviously inherently kind of proves that, right? You have a reason to believe that actually you have a purpose and a meaning as a person and we've already achieved that kind of success on our side of the house. And then secondly there's actually achieving your goals, right? If you like art as a kid, you're like, ""I want to be famous painter, I'm going to become a famous painter,"" So we think this is where that internal motivation is so critical, right? Because it allows you to push through the obstacles or the failures that you experience on your way to achieving those goals. It allows you to actually feel like they're worth achieving, right? That there's a way in which you can succeed in achieving those goals, even if you don't make it all the way to the very end point to those goals, you actually have a reason to continue to pursue them because of that internal belief.",constructive2,5.0,ejones,round6,ejones_round6,0.0,75.0

So even if opposition wants to say the most important thing is helping children achieve their goals in a sort of more concrete sense, like the point of life is being successful in terms of your career or your objective, those kinds of things. I think the critical thing you need to make that happen is a reason to push through those things even when they're difficult a reason to believe that you actually can overcome the situations that sometimes, in the moment, seem impossible to face, right? That you're uniquely able to manage those situations when you have an actual belief within yourself that can only come from your parents in your childhood, that you actually can do the thing, right? Without that motivation you will always be inclined to shy away from those failures, shy away from those obstacles, and you'll never be able to sort of fully self actualized in that way being able to achieve those objectives. So regardless of which sort of version of success you want to prioritize in this debate, I think clearly on opening government we've shown you the best way to get those, is to tell children they have unique values individuals. That in and of itself is already a success and it allows them to push through the kind of complicated obstacles they'll face in their life on their way to achieving their goals, this is what allows them to do that.",constructive3,3.0,ejones,round6,ejones_round6,0.0,75.0

1455,"  Finally, getting on to what Dennis and I substantiate. We tell you that being told your special is bad. Apply with Dennis says. First he says this is bad because family and community obligations. So I feel I'm special and I need to work hard in order to get my family out of poverty, or to continue a cycle of my upward mobility, I'm going to feel incredible pressures. Why is this bad? It's bad for my mental health. It also makes me become a doctor, a computer science major. Even if this doesn't have good society, or for myself, I'm sure there are things that I could be doing better and it makes me feel bad. Then he says these accomplishments are meaningless, because it's only if you're a family.

So you feel a greater sense of personal responsibility and satisfaction if you're completing things for yourself intrinsically, because you have this sense of happiness when you complete them. Also, they're not earned. So... As an example, I think if you get a job just because your dad gives it to you, it's going to feel much less good than if you get a job because you worked for it. And I think have it feeling better because you worked hard incentivizes you to do more work. Then we say that you get less harsh lows because you don't have any desire to improve because of no accountability Yeah. So I think recognizing being you told your specialist bad, if there's more meaningful highs and less meaningful lows... or, yeah. It's because of these reasons. But recognize the reasons we give you are not only not harmful, but Being told that you are a good person because you're kind incentivizes you to work harder, incentivizes you to be a better person. The only chance of ever actually improving yourself. It also gives you less isolation because you're more comfortable asking for help to improve yourself.

1522,"First thing I want to do is framing before I get into the first argument. Talk a little bit about what we think the world actually looks like. So let's go for the first one. We think that success in general is not a guaranteed thing. I want to establish that very clearly. There's four key conditions that we think lead to a late success in general and those are, structural conditions that is like, am I a Latino individual that is growing up in a Western country or things that you can't control. Does my family have money? There's talent and predisposition, right? My unique skill. There's luck. A lot of things are literally just a gamble. Like is it the best investment for the pitch, or is this a good place to be working? Will it actually help me. The one of these conditions that actually is directly controlled by the individual is the effort and hard work they put in. We think we best control that variable because the other variables are not limited by the individual's control, and this is going to become emphatic as we go. The thing I want to highlight is why being special is inherently the relatively special. That is, if everybody is special then nobody is special. A coin is special because it stands out, because it's unique. It has something that is comparable to others and therefore we can assign a value of superiority. We don't necessarily think that children should have the mindset of superiority, like explain them all these arguments. But essentially, if you don't think they're special, you inherently have to be superior to others or stand out from others in some capacity",constructive1,2.0,idonotad,round6,idonotad_round6,0.0,74.0
1523,"The next thing I want to talk about is how this is linked to the expectation of success. So if you have been told that you're special, but essentially because you're superior, you must pursue some sort of grandiose achievement, right? This is what people are conditioned to think. That we must become doctors or lawyers or politicians or whatever society they grew up in determines the definition of success. Not necessarily what they sell to sign something that they preferentially would like to do or something that they find more interesting. So as that is clarified, I want to talk about the first argument that have I've both dealt with it, because we think we want to ship success or standard success and our self-defined version of success or somebody defines their self-worth based on what they want to achieve and whether or not they achieve this, right? We think two things of this. First of all, you break from the societal expectations that you need to do some sort of societal contribution to be successful, right? So essentially that means that you can assign some of the things that you enjoy to your own success and apply the only variable that really matter, and that is hard work and that is determination and that is effort. You'll actually develop your capacity within those fileds, right? You might not be doing the most talented thing, but if you really enjoy coding, then by all means go ahead and practice because practice makes perfect at some point, right? My partner and I are [dead at this room 00:00:02:41] but we still want to keep going because we enjoy how much we're growing. Maybe we're not predisposed, we're not world champions already, but just keeping going is enough for us to learn enough, right? So on that basis we think it's really important, the personal choice and preference as we considered, right?  ",constructive2,4.0,idonotad,round6,idonotad_round6,0.0,74.0
1524,"The second thing I want to consider here is the idea that this is personal choice. And they talk a little bit about that, messed up the distinction, but I think that's pretty clear. Next thing is clearly the idea of how you evaluate effort as the basic thing. So if my child is being told, the way you become successful is through effort, not because you're special, then when they see somebody who can be successful, they will admire the effort that was being put in and they will therefore try and emulate that behavior. We think this role-model behavior... Like if I see somebody become successful at something that I'm interested in, I will try to work just as hard so I can be in that position because I will assume that their position is because of that effort. Even in the case that it is not because of effort and it's because a preexisting conditions, we think that the inspiration of effort is sufficient in a second. Right? So what's more is that we think that effort will be understood to be inherent for success. So we have ways, the generalization of conditions that lead to success. So what she talks about is that you can be successful and that in school you should go and try. Well we think this kind of school, the conditions that led to your success other than hard work and effort tend to be generalists. Right? So we've had to overlook whether somebody has any sort of privilege or any sort of wealth, in favor of the clear fact that they're successful. We tend to disregard those factors. In this world, right? If somebody fails to become successful, we actually become critical of why they did so. If they actually ended up putting in the work and they're not successful, we're actually critical of the conditions that failed to put them up there. So maybe more critical of race relations or gender relations and how they failed to put some people into a position of success or critical of wealth disparities and how they failed to put people in positions of success.

1525,"So let me go ahead and talk about the second point that I have for you. We in general think two ways of this. First of all we think it's not the higher fees because when we assign success to a self ascribed position of success that is not necessarily being rich and famous but maybe just finding a thing you really enjoy, if you just want to be successful. You are living alone and having a garden. That is a definition of success if that makes you self sustaining, right? But essentially at that point where we think we inspire people to make their own individual hierarchies rather than hierarchies related to society, like it's no longer an assignment. You have to be better than everybody else. [crosstalk 00:06:01] share because we think capitalism is inherently hierarchical and that means that you get to disassociate from the hierarchies and therefore find value in your own personal choice and your own personal effort and your own personal work. We're all going to think that should you fail at something at anything then that will hurt your confidence as well. You don't need reaffirmation on something that you're bad or should not be doing. Rather, we think is that it actually helps you find the right position.  So your child, you're experimenting different fields, like maybe I'm interested in this thing and you figure out that you're not necessarily as good at it. You might want to try something else or maybe you can go, ""I'm really into it."" So if you're into it and if you fail and if despite failing, you keep going and you may eventually reach success, we think that this is much more rewarding and much more fulfilling. So essentially what we think is that this creates a position where you can empathize with other people that have dealt with hardship and therefore are more likely to evaluate setbacks and associate with other people that have had setbacks.

The issue with that is that it's not focusing on the ways that you get support for these people. You see it's far superior when we focus on objective truths, not on things. We also say that it's far easier for an idealogue to take power rather than someone who deserves to be in power. Why is this the case? Because they're far better at using things like political rhetoric or attack narratives to say, ""Listen, they don't understand you people. I understand you."" Without actually getting to anything of subjectivity. That means the things like cults of personality based around centers, individual people, not an actual tangible evidence. We see that that's far worse on their side of the house. Why is this the case? You probably get rise in people who are able to get on TV and convince people of massive things without getting tangible change. That means the people that aren't necessarily speakers, which in the status quo and patriarchal societies are women, don't get the opportunity to be able to share their narrative because of the way they've been excluded by society, all right? A man isn't going to vote for a woman if they're not being seen and being relatable. That's a massive issue with the equality. If you can't get access to power, you're not going to be able to do that. They fail to show you on their side of the house that you get any solvency. All right. And also the nature of emotional appeals makes it incredibly hard to critique. How are you supposed to tell someone that their personal story is false? That means if Ben Shapiro is out there saying his far right shit about how people are targeting white Americans and how that's an issue, then you can't say that's not necessarily true because people understand that and relate to that.

Because often times your personal story is too hard to share. You're not going to want to share your personal story because you've got massive trauma associated to it. I don't know. Christine Blasey Ford is a massive exception. Women who've shared experiences like massive sexual trauma aren't going to want to share their personal stories.

I still think that the conception we get from Corey is relatively low burden when he's like, ""Oh well we can still instill some values and let them know that they can achieve everything they want in some aspects."" But also not. So I think that for him to call us low burden and then pull some shit like that, it's a little bit stupid, but whatever, it's fine.

I'm going to talk about [crosstalk 00:01:09] individuality. No alright. So, I would say that the actual scenario, if you're not teaching children that they're special and that they have the means through which to achieve things that they want to achieve, what then are you teaching them? I would say it's either A, nothing. That means that you let the child learn what the world is like on their own. Right? Why is this bad? Because it's more likely that they're going to be beaten down defeated by structures that they're not themselves aware of. Right? But it also leads to a level of conformity when they realize that the only way in which they can succeed over time is to blend in with overall society and instead of focusing on individuality and why themselves, they might be better, they will emulate others instead. Which we tell you is inherently more fun. But, I think the second and probably more likely option because that what Corey's characterized to you, it's the parent directly teaching the child that they aren't special and that there might be specific structural barriers that inhibit their ability to succeed longterm. Right? Why do I think this is bad to teach specifically at an early age. Right? Because I think what this does is create a defeatist mentality right from the beginning, that systems are stacked against you and you don't necessarily have the means through which to actually solve those problems and to overcome those barriers. We tell you that at the very least, telling a child that they are special right from an early age, instills a large amount of confidence in them. Whether or not this confidence is misplaced, we tell you, doesn't actually matter, because you can be stupid yet competent and still do really well in society

Because they're all people that are worried about the structural barriers will realize that they have to opt into this society in order to be successful. Conformity is worse for a couple of reasons. One, you settle for less and two, you don't strive for more. Right? I think that that's the unique impact you get from [Lynn's 00:04:02] extension on our side of the house. A, when you are instilling that confidence at an early age and B, all the impacts we told you about what specifically parenting gets better, hasn't been largely taken down by, Oh, like [Opech 00:04:13] at all. Like really they tried to co-op our parent benefit. But let me explain this a little bit more to you-... and tell you why it's [Nuance 00:04:18] analysis doing this All right, so when you are a parent, and you tell your child over and over and over again that they are special individuals, you as a parent are going to subconsciously develop that expectation or that view of your child as special. What does that mean? Right? That means that it creates this perpetual cycle where because you believe your child is special, you are more likely to divert more resources and invest more into their nurture and their care and their wellbeing because you yourself view that as special. Right? So what this means and what Lynn just told you here specifically about parents as actors, is that when parents are more incentivized to increase basically resources poured into their child, it means that whether or not that child was special to begin with, that child is going to be better off than children that don't have that level of attention invested into them because they have more resources.

Just listen to a second and more important extension. Why is this only available under a monotheistic system? First, I'm going to give you a characterization of what monotheistic does look like. I think opening government and closing government pretty much agrees that only under a polytheistic religion that can have both good and bad gods. Why is it then, that on monotheistic side, you only have the best, you only have the one perfect god? And why is this good? Firstly, this seems to be historically true. Under any sort of monotheistic religion, because people in that religion want their god to be seen as the best, they usually construct their god, or have a belief, or interpretation of that god, being perfect, having no flaws. But secondly, we think for these individuals, these religious individuals, god probably is the most important person to them. It is a sole reason of their existence. It is a sole reason why they do anything in life. This means that the construction of god on our side of the house is perfect, is someone that is flawless in every single way possible. Opening government and closing government then tries to tell you that this is bad, because this is unrelatable. Why is this not true? And why does this uniquely mean that people are able to better connect with god on our side of the house. No, thank you. Firstly, you have a common moral code, that every aspires to on our side of the house. Recognize that opening government and closing government tries to tell you there are benefits to having balance. But they never really show how that balance plays out in status quo. We think that's important, Well thank you, because simply asserting that there is a balance with different gods does not mean that people value each god the same amount. The reason why sexism is rampant in India is because obviously the male asymmetrically prioritized the god of sexism. I don't if that exists or not.

I think the point in which you have one perfect god, that god never makes mistakes, and evil happens, then people that follow that monotheistic religion get the message, ""God created us, God wants us to fix the problem."" This is a fundamental distinction you have from both sides of the house. On their side, they can justify the existence of evil by pointing at gods, without getting any solvency, without getting any mechanisms because it is god who has created that evil. There are gods that represent evil on their side of the house. Compare it to our side of the house. When god, and the one god you believe in, believes that you, as and individual is perfect, that you can strive to become better, means that individuals on our side of the house are more likely to fight back to evil. Because the common moral code that people under a monotheistic religion lives under, means that they perfectly look up to the one single god, who is perfect, who is virtuous, who is forgiving, means that I want have those values as well. This means that people fundamentally act different in the face of evil on both sides of the house. This is unique, and we think this is something that is the most important. Much more important than any discussion you get on their side of the house. The fact that individual can have hope on our side of the house, not blame god, an entity that they cannot means that people always believe, and they always have hope on our side of the house. Recognize the characterization they give you on the evil, and the existence of evil gods, mean that individuals are hopeless, probably means that they are being condemned by that god, probably does not have any sort of hope, or any other alternative to find more meaning in life because it is an evil god that is condemning them.

I've never seen you in my life. I didn't go and rape and murder your family."" That brings a lot of emotional trauma to victims. And as a result, they don't want to go and face that, especially under the pretenses that they know that prosecution is a 50/50 throw in the air. That's to say that individuals don't want to put themselves through emotional duress for a speculative end goal that might not even occur in the first place. That's the burden that you place, and the onus that you place on victims to come forward with their testimonies, especially in an adversarial court of nature.

Oftentimes liquid cash is simply harder to attain because oftentimes liquid cash is going away in a lot of daily expenditures and things like that.

Because oftentimes the fact that punitive taxing is extremely scary for a lot of families and a lot of individuals, meaning a lot of families who are within the middle class or even lower middle class, so a spectrum, know they are going to be unable to pay these taxes to begin with.

Second, they can often afford to pay the taxes as well. So at the end of the day, the harms of do trickle down to the individuals who are at the lower end of the spectrum. But if this imbalance occurs while the individuals are now going to have complete control of prices of housing, this is extremely detrimental because then they're only going to rent out their housing at prices that is palatable to either richer individuals or upper middle class individuals, meaning people in the middle and people in the lower spectrum are now unable to one buy these property, this property as well.

We talked to you about the false sense of security and validation that parents socialize these children into; that these very qualities are ingrained from the very get go. The child belonging to a tender mindset is ingrained with the idea that they are destined for greatness, that they are destined to achieve something that's greater than them. All of that is judgment and analysis from our opposition, that was never really engaged with your proposition. He talked about how when this protective shell is broken, when they grew up, there are different ways in which these children lash out. There are ways they lash out at the community, they lash out back at the parents themselves.

Because you're talking about children under the age of 10 who are dependent on whatever their parents say, who are dependent on every sense of direction that their parents provide to them. And this is something that we also ask them in a BOI. We started off with saying that, if we encourage these mistakes, we are going to, in some way, you're going to relate or convey this message that they are inherently special. But we think that team government is trying to confuse positive reinforcement or encouragement with just inculcating the core ideas of someone being distinct, someone being special, which is the core of the debate. Because normal encouragement, ladies and gentlemen, is something that happens in the day to day basis. Telling a child, ""Okay, all right, you can try this next time."" It's not necessarily making them feel that they are inherently special. When there's a child who isn't playing well in soccer telling them that he is a good soccer player. But there are just external forces that aren't allowing you to be as successful as you can be. You think that is something that makes them feel inherently special, telling them that ""it's not your fault, but it's society's fault."" That it's society's fault why you're not as successful as it should've been in the first place. Which is why we think this idea of encouragement and appreciation is very different from what the grade test should be.

1708,"First of all is the idea of what the parents role in the upbringing of the child is. The parents role is to make sure the child feels secure, the child feels safe and it's their responsibility to make sure to protect them from all sorts of harm: psychological harm, physical harm and mental harm. And we're going to show you how, in this model the children, when they grow up, are harmed in all three of these ways. Because what happens when you can bring this message that they, this child are inherently special, we see that there is a rise of community: a community of Incels. Find all those nice guys who grew up, the Intel's who grew up thinking that they would have achieved way more, but the way that lashed back out at the community is like something that the community faces a lot of backlash from. We think this is one of the major drawbacks of this policy. But secondly this idea of entitlement When you're telling the child from the very get go they can achieve a lot of things in the future, there is a sense of entitlement. They feel that they are entitled to greatness. They feels that there is inherently special about them and we feel that it leads, at least we feel that it can also narrow the horizon of what a child itself can do. Making decisions by themselves. If you like, we feel like this the parents putting the children to a specific track, which children often feel pressurized to be something or to do something before that",constructive1,5.0,kamilaslam,round6,kamilaslam_round6,0.0,76.0
1709,"But at the same time we think it's a parents responsibility to make a child more aware of their surroundings. It's the responsibility of a parent to tell the child that he is not doing well. We think that that is also very important when you're upbringing the child because you can put them in a protective shell. You can provide them this false sense of security and validation for the rest of the life because then that validation is something that they become dependent on. Then that false sense of security is something that they rely on afterwards as well, and once, when they grow up and don't have two parents to sustain or channelize their energy or need for validation, that is when they start lashing out. And then the idea is like, we don't think that the debate is necessarily about the mistakes necessarily made. We think it's more, we don't think it's really about the mistakes that you're going to make because I think that mistakes, in either case, we think that children should have encouraged to make mistakes, but in no way in our model are we discouraging or disincentivizing children to go out and make mistakes in which way they can better improve themselves. What we feel is that in our, in our model, when we have parents better telling children what they can do and better informing children how they're performing and being more sincere with them, We think that idea of sincerity also make sure that the parent child relationship is sustained.",constructive2,2.0,kamilaslam,round6,kamilaslam_round6,0.0,76.0

Because afterwards we think it can result in distrust between the parent and children, which is something that we see even more in day and age. Where children lash out just because of the false promises that the parents made on behalf of them, the false conviction that they set for them.

656,"To go into my positive material, emotion and subjective experience prevent your message from being listened to. We see this with movements like Occupy Wall Street. There's a movement in 2008 as a result of the financial collapse and the recession because of the corruption and deregulation of Wall Street that allowed the financial crash to happen. This is a protest movement where everyone rallied in the streets and they had drum circles going all day for weeks. There were people out camping. It was a huge protest movement, but it was ultimately unsuccessful because they failed to push their movement outside of the realm of emotion because people were hurt. People felt hurt because of the financial collapse, but they didn't bring any substantive policy change, and so nothing happened. They relied too much on how the collapse made them feel rather than what they were going to do about it. So it resulted in basically only drumming and riots and a general distaste and anger towards the system that they were trying to protest. We also see this with commentators like Ben Shapiro who make their careers off of quote, ""Dunking on liberal snowflakes."" These people use the emotions of their opponents, they cherry pick the people who are most emotional, who have the most emotional response to whatever he says. He makes them look like fools because their argumentation isn't there, and then he profits off of that even though he doesn't have to do any of the work.

657,"For my second point, I want to talk about how change happens. Let's talk about the anti-war protests in 1968 in Chicago. We saw the anti-war movement in much of the same way. A lot of times it was focused on the emotion of wanting to be free in a society that didn't want them to step out of line in a lot of ways, and also that wanted to end the war and end the government control that was forcing them into it. But these people, like in what Occupy Wall Street did not organize around that, they instead focused on the lifestyle changes they wanted to make and the anecdotal feelings of the members of the movement and how they felt towards the government that was oppressing them. So when you had those protests that were televised and the police brutality that happened, the movement was so focused on emotion and so unrelatable to most people in middle America who were seeing them on TV. A lot of people who couldn't relate to that movement because they didn't understand the argumentation rather than the points that they were trying to make. A lot of the people who saw that movement rallied for the cops, they enjoyed watching the hippies there get beat up and pepper sprayed and everything because they thought that it was just a bunch of emotional people who didn't want to fight for their country, who weren't patriotic or anything. They thought they were just people who were guided by emotion and not by reasoning. So we see that these people were not able to get their message across because of the emotion that so eclipsed their points. A lot of times movements based on emotion rather than substance and policy ideas push people away and render themselves moot by not clarifying what they actually believe in, what they actually want to have done.

This is why we give you the very specific argumentation about what the society in which we were growing up looks like. So, I want to explain that first. Rich kids have the world arranged around them and to suit their needs and their interests. They don't need to be told that they're special because their living experience tells them that they themselves are special. They are more deserving because they have individualized attention. Because you have your wealth, you have the wealth and concentration of power and sweat. Did you grow up with everything arranged to your liking due wealth due to society being structured in your interests, the institutional arrangements? It's quite natural for you to think that you are in fact special. What they fail to contend with though is that the vast majority of children do not grow up in this way. The vast majority of children grow up in underfunded schools. They grow up in underfunded neighborhoods who are lacking opportunity and they don't have a meaningful way to improve their life chances. This is why we say that parents should tell their children that they are speciaL. That in the face of all of this they are special, they deserve dignity, that they too are able to achieve whatever it is they want to do. So, our argument is that given the existing structural arrangements, because children are systematically told they do not matter.

And secondary education and I was talking about universities, but also the trade schools, which is where a lot of the students who may not be very good readers or very good mathematicians or anything like that because not everyone's the same and you all bring different skills and all those skills will need to be enhanced later on when...",constructive1,,ksbrown,round2,ksbrown_round2,0.0,75.0

When we're looking at minorities especially, as my partner brought up, there's this whole often-quoted, right-wing idea of 13 percent where they say 13 percent of minorities commit 50 percent of all crimes. And they use that to justify a lot of different, very harmful, policies to others. And they're using that under a very objective standpoint that yeah, this does happen. It does. They're able to use numbers and hard facts, which, under this current narrative, people way higher than they do exploit lived experiences and emotions in order to justify very harmful policies towards minorities like Chris, which, under Bloomberg in New York, he said that, ""Oh it's reduced dramatically, so it's a good idea,"" even though it's actually has led to more victimization of people who may be innocent of minorities. And you can see that what's happening is: focusing solely on data, or even just placing a higher emphasis on data and these objective numbers and percentages and facts, are able to be used as a guise by bad actors in order to actually harm those who are most vulnerable in a society. And what we're saying is that in total, what's going to happen is that this is going to negatively impact policy-making as a whole not only for minorities, but for everyone because of this apparent subjectivity of a human experience. So what happens is that objective policies are not really objective whatsoever because everyone has their own situations and affiliations and biases. And what happens is people are able to hide these biases under this horrible objective ideology and be able to interpret the data that they either collected or are given in order to fit their own world view.",constructive1,,ksbrown,round3,ksbrown_round3,0.0,71.0
613,"No, we don't believe that at all. In fact, we're saying that under this current narrative, they're saying not to do that because it says we should focus on what's objective. They would say you should sympathize as criminals and you shouldn't sympathize with minorities as much because they're more likely to commit crimes on our side. You should focus more on empathy and on the human emotions of individuals and have that be higher-weighed over top of political discourse and debate, the numbers of which can often be skewed and interpreted according to one's own biases or moral views. You see it... you saw it in the eighties in the nineties a lot of crime think-states that come out and push a lot of studies, a lot of data, as important, political think-tank censes to create objective ways to sort of filter their world view through a political debate. And what we see is that what these things are doing was creating studies and economic policies that were seen to be objective and scientific that instead of pushed sparkle policies like Progressive Tax Policy, ""freakoconomics"", ""stop and frisk""... All these harsh-on-crime, broken windows ideas that are in actuality very harmful to the emotions and the lived experience of individuals under this guise that is, instead, a very objective sense of policy, and that the facts are never wrong and that instead we should, that we should focus on these facts instead of the actual emotions and lived experiences of individuals... Because what's happening in politics, and the whole impact of politics in general, is going to impact not only human beings in, well let's say, economic wealth and everything, but also how they live their lives. And when we look at how people live their lives, it's heavily impacted by their mental state and their emotional system. So what's going to happen under the side of the status quo and this current narrative that we're writing, what's already happening is that people are losing their sense of humanity. They're being ""othered"" under this whole idea that we should look at people as numbers, as we look at statistics as being higher and more valuable than what actually happens in real life to the individuals that might not be able to be quantified numerically again.",constructive1,,ksbrown,round3,ksbrown_round3,0.0,71.0

We believe that the current narrative promotes other ways and has this, as I said, as one of its key ideas under this idea of objectivity. When you know the status quo weighs objectivity and political debate over emotions and lived experiences, it's able to create this idea that, ""Oh, I might feel bad for individuals and I might be able to empathize with them, but the numbers don't lie. So I just have to follow up this more objective idea that might not even be objective at all is instead being interpreted by the bad actors, like big think-tanks and such in order to fit their own worldview.. And when you talk, then opposition for yourself. This whole idea of fun, informed citizens being manipulated by emotions. I believe that what happens instead is that uninformed citizens can be a lot easier manipulated by data because under this current model, data is seen as a high standard. So when you have different news sources pushing, there own interpretations of data that might not be correct, there might be bias as data can often be, data is not, in fact, unbiased. There's different ways to study. Uninformed citizens are going to end up being informed by that and that, moreover, how their neighbors are actually living their lives. They're not going to be able to empathize with their neighbors because they're the numbers don't lie. Instead they're not able to actually hold... be able to be held accountable.

So that's because we actually look at some actor analysis on how both children and parents are impacted by this way and talk about how in the longterm and holistically children are affected worth... Worse by the model presented by OG and CG than under any sort of status quo, or any sort of model in which we actually try and create more realistic expectations for children and aren't saying that they are especially unique and special and that is an inherent part of them that they were born with. I'll get to later.",constructive1,5.0,ksbrown,round6,ksbrown_round6,0.0,75.0

You look at the other individuals in this worldview, because kids, even if they're not rational actors, they are impacted by how parents say they're not stupid. I don't think anyone's kids, children are inherently stupid and don't understand what their parents are saying when they say they're special. They don't either think people are special and there are other ways which might be positive or negative or they think those are the only special treatment. Yeah. We think that if anything that does make sure that your ego is enhanced. I can't speak to you as an individual. I don't know you very well. But what's happening is this is enforcing this ego, and you know your parents might want to say, Oh, you know other people did well too. Kind of humble you if you anything. If parents actually wanted to make sure their children were well developed. I can't really talk too much more about that. But essentially what we're saying is, yeah, that's going to create this inflate ego and this superity complex and in the, as it does in the status quo, as it does to lots of people. And this does lead to a lesser ability to empathize and socialize and later in life when you're a developing human being, you need to be humble sometimes and feel humility and feel as if you're part of something greater than yourself as opposed to just being an individual.",constructive2,5.0,ksbrown,round6,ksbrown_round6,0.0,75.0
1814,"And that also comes with our second substantive point about this inability to deal with failure. Because when you lift up students or even as children a lot, when you know society eventually knocks them down, they're going to have a way larger fall under OG's model. And we've already talked about how they're either going to, they're basically going to see this as innate to themself, that they are innately failures. Because under the system it's all about how the, you're special, you're inherently special and all everything you do comes from how you were born. No thank you. I already answered that POI. So what happens instead is that they are going to blame it on themselves and not feel as if, Oh, should work harder or I should, should maybe limit my expectations. Instead they're going to be like, I'm neither special and thus I should just keep throwing myself at this challenge without reexamining why, or they are going to play it on themselves and internalize this failure.",constructive3,5.0,ksbrown,round6,ksbrown_round6,0.0,75.0

And the parents are one of the main actors in this debate because they're the ones who are teaching their children this. And what's going to happen is these parents are actually going to make their children resent them later in life and there's going to be a bigger breakdown in the family values. Because, yeah, essentially, after these great falls, these children are going to realize as even brings up that society is not what the parents said they are and that society is teaching them that it's tough, it's a horrible world out there.

It integrates the de factoly segregated cultures, and it ensures that everyone can actually get into home ownership. It's not this nightmarish, socialist world. This actually makes the housing market more equitable, more accessible, and that is a net good for society. In the current model, most lower income people have their money going to rent barons, which they don't even bring it up, but that's actually what it is.

1428," In my first point of constructive, I'm going to give the proof why that's wrong. So, moving on into that first point, which is the nature of political discourse. Politics is uniquely positioned because it inherently benefits off of emotional manipulation. Political debates are won by getting more people to your side, not through actual policy, but through the manipulation of emotions. What are some examples of this? The frequent demagoguery that we've seen in recent years where people win elections and win debates simply because they can get up, shout the loudest and make people feel scared. That is emotional manipulation to the highest degree, where you go on stage and you say, ""These people are coming for your land, these people that are doing this."" That is using emotionality and subjective experiences to instill fear in a populace in order to make a political gain. That's the inherent nature of politics and governments' work. What else does this mean? This means that... The use of emotional values in debate increases the political divide because you no longer have objective disagreements with people, you also have subjective disagreements. You disagree with them on points and then continue to disagree with them as their existence as a person, precisely because your fears have been stoked and they have been cast as the enemy. That is textbook use of emotions in politics. That's why we have such a heavy divide in areas that have two-party systems because the narrative is not, ""Oh, well, we just have some political differences from them. Objectively, they're wrong, we're right."" The narrative is, ""They're wrong, they're coming for our humanity."" That is not okay.",constructive1,4.0,ls5871,round3,ls5871_round3,0.0,74.0
1429,"values that have some effect on society and Gov's world, but you're not actually talking about the mechanisms that are deeply affecting your life and that is an inherently dangerous situation to get into. Now I'm going to move into how politics exists in our world. In the opposition's world, politics exist as pure civil discourse. The ability to say we are debating about policy from an objective standpoint where we can look at the mechanisms of the decisions we are making, without being blurred by emotional ties. What does this do? The actual ethicacy of political split discussions increase, because people are actually again talking about the mechanisms that affect their daily lives rather than saying, ""well you know this is really emotionally dear to me and that's why it's important"". They can also say ""this is important because if we don't pass comprehensive healthcare reform, these four things are going to happen or these four things are not going to happen"". Also, if not fettered by emotionality may... [Inaudible 00:05:40] , it's progressed a lot further. We've all seen footage from the Senate floor for example, where the people are just shouted down because they say something inflammatory to the other side that is actually trying to talk about real policy. This is again another way in which emotionality suppresses truth. This also reduces the dramatization of politics. When people are actually talking about policy, you don't have these issues of these figures coming out and saying like, ""Oh, we're going to do this. We're going to do that. You should fear this group because I need to go into power"". It stops the political circus. And because emotionality is removed, actual informed debate occurs. And because of this, policy which is the end result of political debate, works better. You actually walk through the mechanisms of each policy, which means that the policy is actually implemented in a way that reflects not only the debate, but also reflects the actual needs of the mechanisms. And saying that, ""Oh, well, you can still have that with emotionality"", just frankly isn't true because there are many times where people get up to support a point only because of an emotional tie to it.

They can't just say oh well we'll just sit on our slow economic growth because of our high currency rate.

Because this is a place where, as a child, you are taught how to think critically. And we think that is important when you grow up. Because, let's remember that, for example, poor people are people who don't have access to these programs around the world. And those are also, for example, the people who don't vote. And as a result of that, what happens is that politicians who are being elected or not elected by them and do not work for them.

So that class disparity can be reduced if people are taught to think critically from the beginning. We're also, I should mention that we're also, subsidizing the work on childcare facilities curiculms. So, that will be happening.

Because let's realize that the aim of a political debate is to realize what causes should be enacted, and how our socio-economic problems should be solved through politics. And that is not simply happening in the status quo. Because the problem is that we have no idea what to do with either of our problems. And the reason for that is because we all appeal so much to the emotions, politicians don't care about solutions. They don't even present you with solutions. They use a lot of rhetoric and rhetoric, that is the problem. Rhetoric should not be ruling our political sphere. Because what that leads to is a lot of ad hominin and personal attacks, and we just don't think that that is a very productive, political debate. For example, look at the examples that the side government here brought. For example, climate change, right? The two sides, there are two different examples related to that. The first one was that we see that they say, for example, that climate change affects younger generation. But realize that that same narrative can happen on the opposite side too, right? And this is the problem with appealing to that emotions. You no longer know what actual facts are. You can say that, ""Okay. It affects the younger generation,"" but on the other side you can say, ""Well, people lose their manufacturing jobs."" So, that happens.

I think you need to recognize how much legitimacy the federal government loses when it literally says it doesn't care about providing its citizens essential services such as health care, access to proper nutrition, no, access to proper nutrition, all things that are life saving services that will now be annexed from various citizens of the government because of something their state government did.",constructive1,,maiyawerba,round5,maiyawerba_round5,0.0,74.0

We think that every experience is necessarily subjective, because only one person cannot experience someone else's life. So every experience is subjective. But what it means for something to be objective is if many people have experienced the same phenomenon. So for example, even if my experience of of police being racist to me is a subjective experience, if millions of other people have experienced the same thing, then we can think police brutality is an objective phenomenon in America. So that's what objectivity means for us. So then that definition sort of takes up all these arguments made in the GW about how their responses to for example. They say that people like MLK were portrayed as crazy. We think that even if there's some strategization of MLK as being crazy or too violent, we think that the fact that the millions of black people or white people banded together and supported MLK, that proves that MLK's movement was actually an objective movement, which means that their responses do not apply or do interact with others.",constructive1,,meganwu,round3,meganwu_round3,0.0,75.0

We think that the methodologic difference between those two things means that it's more likely that people with agenda setting power will take advantage of emotions and use it as a means to discredit people. The second reason why we think that it's more likely that elites will co-opt anger than activists will use anger to mobilize it is that there's a bunch of examples out there and ones that we have given you about how in the past, subjectivity has been used to discredit valid and good positions. For example, climate change deniers look at the same facts as everyone else, but then manipulate those facts into the interest of the elite, which are oil corporations with large money and a lot of agenda setting power. We think that's an example of how subjectivity is used to create terrible political and it's been mobilized by elites. The flip side of this is that even when there's a group of people who are super angry but don't have any direction to direct their anger in. People like Trump or populists are able to take that anger and direct it towards a terrible cause like the immigrants from this country. The last example that I'll bring up is how British colonizers in India created the modern day cast system by turning people against each other in order to create conflict between classes. This is an example of how subjective experiences were mobilized to benefit the interest of the elite, which is why we think that objectivity is better. Now, the last comparative between the probability of elites co-opting anger and the probability of activists using anger to mobilize is this that, if it's the case that elites are going to discredit activist movements, we think that it's better for activist movements to change their strategies, rather than just to feed into what elites want them to do.",constructive2,,meganwu,round3,meganwu_round3,0.0,75.0

And laws against Muslim headgear, for example, will definitely strain relations with the primarily Muslim countries.

You need to give a reasoning behind your opinions and often that's not going to be factually based. It's going to be based on a different lived experiences of every single person. Everyone's going to have a different experience whether it's socioeconomically, racially, everyone going to have a different perspective to bring in. By not listening to those facts, we actually limit political discourse because now people are not able to talk about the root cause of the problems, which is actually what we need to address by just talking about facts. We're kind of glossing over what's actually more important which is the deep reasons why these things happen.",constructive1,,mpoot,round3,mpoot_round3,0.0,76.0

So not just what are the policies so example, that I want to talk about. It's basically just policing so we can see through facts and figures where's being policed, who's being policed when they're being policed, but we don't know people's experiences with police and we've seen that that's actually a pretty negative thing, especially here. There's a lot of tensions between these people, but we don't know that if we're just looking at, ""Oh, they're policing this area more."" We need to get the actual story behind the figures. So what we see without this world where we bring subjective experience, we just see again numbers but this doesn't reflect the lived experience of people. At the end of the day, what we need to do is fill in the blanks with the gaps in our knowledge with the actual reality of the people who are living in these circumstances. What happens when you tend to bring in too much objective facts is it kind of glosses over a broad spectrum of people. We have to acknowledge that everyone is going to have a different experience and what happens with stats specifically and why I want to talk about stats, how they're not necessarily as effective is the stats tend to be, as we've seen, it's all about majority rules. So if we are in a situation where majority rules all the time and we're looking at what's best for the most people, that's going to ignore a much bigger subsection of people who are not fitting to this very clear cut idea of what we should be looking for.",constructive2,,mpoot,round3,mpoot_round3,0.0,76.0

We're not a theocracy and this is not going to make us into one. This is actually going to lead us toward being a more secular state that is not based on religion. Especially when in Quebec, Christianity is the dominant religion, it has been for a long time. So this is actually over proportionally representing the dominant religion, and putting other smaller groups of religions after us. ",constructive1,,mpoot,round5,mpoot_round5,0.0,70.0

It talks about crosses, it talks about hijabs are just the example used in the motion, but it also includes all religious freedom, so it's not like it's saying ""Oh, Christians, you're fine to wear this, but the Muslims, absolutely not."" So it doesn't just discriminate on that, so it doesn't just discriminate against certain religious groups, and it actually helps groups who are in a smaller position because what it does...so it removes religion from specifically from provincial employees. So these are people who are being exposed. They're usually in government positions, they're teachers, they're federal, they're provincial employees who work in the government. So these are people who have massive impact in the way that our society runs which we do not again want that to be based on religion. Teachers are literally...they're in a position where they have massive influence on the people the students that they are teaching. So what we don't want is from a very young age to expose them, to just especially when you're in a place where there is a dominant religion, to what religion. If we have a bunch of teachers who are all religious and they're all Christian, that's not that they expose people, and I think it actually forces religious view on something that should be a secular thing, like school.

There's also just considering they'll probably take on some of the taxes, it's just getting more expensive. They won't get as much money for that because there is now a disincentive to keep investing in selling these single family homes.

First, because like Chris said, it's just more cost effective to build one house that can be sold, to getting rented to multiple people. Second, there's public pressure from the government who is trying to solve the housing crisis. And third, because like they said, they're going to be concerned about this tax if it's true, that if this counts personal housing because we don't know if that's true. But if that's true and if they live in that, then they would rather be able to use the same amount of land to get multiple payouts from multiple people renting and therefore, they'll likely want to build the multi-family homes which solves their issue on raising rent as well as it increases our link for why we are likely to get multi-family homes in the future.",constructive1,,mstonem,round1,mstonem_round1,0.0,76.0

1324,"brain development. These formative years, zero to five scientifically show that this is when children gain literacy and awareness, both socially and academically. Those are both very important. We will get into those how they differ and how they're both necessary. Studies actually show a lot of universities have researched that these years are way more formative and lead to greater success, when kids have an education that's stronger in years zero to five than later. A lot of people have done studies about it actually. You can look it up. Why is this? Why, why? I could just say for the years that studies are showing, but why don't aren't they showing, because they develop social groups. Imagine you're an only child and your parents. You're an only child so you don't have other kids to be around and play with. You're growing up and you don't really know. When you're going to this earlier education socially, this is where you gain your social footing. So you learn how to share, how to be respectful, how to care for others, what a friend is. Because at home if you're not having this education, what are you supposed to do? These things carry on the rest of your lives. The higher education gets more specific and specific and specific it gets; how to make a friend. How do I know? How do I have respectful conversation with other people? Those are things that we have now, and I use every day, but I developed when I was younger and that's what builds the emotional intelligence.
But in addition to emotional intelligence, we think academic intelligence is great too. You learn to walk, learn. Teachers at a young age can make learning exciting. You're not going to be, sometimes when you get older and older, learning is you're going to class and you're like, ""Oh, whatever."" But these kids are still excited. They're still in their earlier age. I'll take you in one minute. Where they will be excited about learning and teachers can do that. These are equal in importance. Having the emotional intelligence, the academic intelligence. Why does more funding help with this? Better facilities for these kids can pay for better teachers who have more training and more education. That's the financial end. ",constructive1,,mswan,round2,mswan_round2,0.0,71.0
1325,"the only education you're getting. This is something that's really critical. We must invest in the education that everyone is getting. If, let's just say 100%, 95% of the population gets primary education and past primary education, globally speaking, a small percentage of the world actually continues on that.
Let's just say I know, hypothetical. Let's say 50% of people do. But if you're investing in primary education, you are literally helping the most number of people because more people do primary education than anything else. So you're investing in the most amount of people, which is great. In a lot of countries, you go to primary education and then you go into work. These skills that you learned in primary education help you with, those are the ones that are critical to working. If you have specific skills you can learn them in job training and stuff like that. But, I have to say that these secondary education doesn't really have the big impact on how to communicate and how to cooperate with others. It's critical and getting into financial, because the whole thing, it's why would you vote for more finances? In the other countries for example, like Africa.
Students need uniforms to go to school, they need uniforms or they need books and sometimes those things are requirements. You need a uniform to go to school, but this is really hard on families with low income so this helps ease the burden and make sure that everyone gets to the same place, starts from the same place. I'll take you in 30 seconds. In these schools, if two kids have to share a book and if then you don't have textbooks for all the kids, then they're only going to be getting half the assets to these things. And that's critical because at these early ages, kids are still learning how to learn and if they have their own materials, they're going to be more excited to do that. And that means at home. When the kids go home after school and they're having their work with them. If they're able to afford the books to bring home and study, they're going to develop a love for that.

Parents might be dead, they might get incarcerated, they also just might not be present and invested in the education. But if we can invest in this, teachers are role models for these kids. You look up, imagine your three year old coming into school every day. Your teacher's like, ""Oh he's so tall. He's so cool. I want to be friends with him. Oh my gosh, that's amazing."" And like these teachers are role models that often in a perfect world, everyone would have a parent that helped guide them but that's not the world we reside in. These parents' limitations, shackle kids from really having that positive role model and seeing what they can then become. These teachers can provide a clear roadmap to that. They look up to them and what does that create a world? It creates a world of dreamers. That a future looking down the line, kids who want to do things with their life instead maybe you have a bad role model at home and you see your parents drinking alcohol all the time and just sitting around.

Right? And so what Anish proposed was going after the politicians who are responsible for these laws cause politicians our book go on to propose them and get them through what will happen when we target these politicians, right?

Why harm them? We are wanting specifically to target those who are oppressive so that they can reform and that's where we do that. No, and then so now we're going to move on in the last minute and a half to are like, just to recap our contentions, right? So we already talked about the first one.

They did not review this, which, so it probably would stand, which Anish brought up is saying that like, okay, all of these are reactive methods, right?

It's pertinent for parents to point out mistakes and that can happen under our [offside 00:02:03] model. Mistakes are how children learn. You make a mistake, you accidentally... You're in a restaurant and you throw your food across the way. I mean those are young kids but people make mistakes and it's up to parents to instruct their kids. That is extremely different from them telling them, ""I love you. You're special. You want to do this? You can do it."" Right? Mistakes... And if parents are able to tell their kids they're going to be more encouraged to work on those mistakes because they know that they have the ability because their parents influence them and tell them that yes, I'm special and the kids will know I'm valued and since the parents value me, I'm more likely to listen to them and capitalize on my mistakes and that leads...Why is it important for kids to do that? Right. Because kids need to internalize the thing, mistakes happen and by in this model welcoming mistakes, in the future when kids have that happen, they'll learn them and they'll take them as a learning experience rather than something that they're afraid of.",constructive1,3.0,mswan,round6,mswan_round6,0.0,74.0
1821,"great. This is children 10 and under. These kids have aspirations and maybe they might all pan out. We're not living in some utopian world where everything fantasize is great, but why should the parents deter kids at this young age when they don't even know yet what they want to be. They're not even a high school or college yet. Let them be dreamers. You always hear this thing, the next generation of dreamers, but at this age kids just want to live happy lives and they don't want to be held down by their parents. ""Mom, dad, I want to be an astronaut."" ""No, you're never going to do that."" That's shitty, Right? You don't want that. Be like, ""You know what? You work hard. Maybe you can go to NASA."" That's cool. And I think it also... Feeling valued. Right? So why is feeling valued good? Two-pronged reason, right? Feeling value not only enhances your confidence and then when you go out in the world you're proud to present your ideas and show yourself and share yourself. But it also enhances relationships with parents, right? Straight relationship with parents is a really real thing. But if your parents tell you that you're special you're going to be like, ""Oh my God. Mom, dad, you're so nice. I really appreciate you. Thank you. And I really appreciate myself now because of you."" By feeling value you also share that value back, which I think is really important. Let's say an example, right? Your kid has a talent show. They're going to go on and sing and they're really nervous. They're like, ""Oh mom, I don't know if I can sing."" And they might not be Beyonce. Far from it. But if your parents tell you that you're a special person and we really believe in you, at that age you're not at the point yet where being an amazing singer is going to really make or break you. But, sometimes kids are afraid. They haven't experienced the world yet and they go to their parents when they need direction. And if their parents tell them, ""We believe in you.""

1822,"The third contention is that it teaches them to push the barriers and explore new terrain without fear. Right? It leads to more questioning and critical thinking, which are things that we really need. If they're told you can do this and you can do that, then kids are going to approach us and when they see an issue that doesn't seem right to them, they're going to have that confidence to say, ""You know what? Maybe this shouldn't be that way."" Right? This leads to the generation of aspirational youth. It leads to people who don't accept no for an answer, but push to new frontiers. It leads to people who don't say, ""Why is there a problem in the world?"" But, ""How can I fix that problem?"" Right? That is the next generation of people that we want. We are plagued through so many issues in this world including... I know it's a cliche to say climate change, but it is a big ass deal, right? If you're questioning and they're like, ""Oh my God. Son. Daughter. Great question. You should ask more those."" You're going to be encouraged to do that. But if you're not getting that, You might still do it but it's going to be to a lesser extent. And that's the assumption that we're going to side under. And because of that... But the point is, I'm thinking about in the world where they're not encouraged and if they don't have this special and love for their parents, they grow up feeling less valued. And if they're feeling less valued, then when they present their opinions they're going to be less confident because they think that they're less important. That is going to lead... And that is what takes on in the future. We think that if we're trying to build a people who in the future, vote for positive change and really push that boundary, that's what we want our world to become.

If you didn't, if you weren't able to go to preschool or kindergarten, then you're already behind. You didn't get to start learning math and start learning reading to the same level that other children did when you first get into school. So you're already disadvantaged when you start, you're already behind. And that carries out through your entire education because generally this is a geographical issue. Many of the people with these problems are in the same area and they're going to the same schools. So you have an entire school of kids who are behind because they didn't have these early childhood programs. And so these areas and these demographics of people aren't going to have the same opportunity to get to college as kids from better off areas. So when we fund these sorts of programs, we actually get this solid baseline education for these children. They're able to actually catch up in their education, they're able to have a higher quality of education and it equalizes the entire system, and it gives them a better chance of being able to go to college later on, right? Without this sort of funding for these sorts of programs, you simply don't get that, right? And especially in developing countries who are in so many cases, these programs simply do not exist. It's not like maybe you can't afford to go to them or something, it's they just don't exist. So with this type of funding, not only are you able to subsidize it for people who maybe can't afford it, you're also able to give that money to actually start having these programs in some places that don't have it. And so now kids who maybe people weren't able to send them to preschool or school at all in lots of areas of rural [00:02:56] they don't even have child labor laws, so they just send their kids to go work or work for the family or something like that.

They say that college is just a signaling mechanism and that's absolutely right. It has a lot of it, for a lot of cases it doesn't have much value. As they said, many people can do any job, right? So the college degree is just a barrier for them anyway. If you put more of the funding onto these early childhood programs, then you're giving less importance to the college education, right? Because you're putting the funding elsewhere, you're signaling that, Hey, this college education isn't as important, right? So now that you get this idea that the college education isn't as important from the signaling that it doesn't need the funding and it's not as important as the actual primary school in early childhood. Then you get to see that the college thing is just a signaling thing and you can get many jobs, and many important jobs, in our society that either don't require a college degree right now and are pivotal to society working just having jobs like being a janitor, or a plumber, or truck drivers or things or a lot of stuff like that. They're necessary for our society. But right now people see those jobs as being lesser and people who do those jobs as being lesser because they think that Oh, you couldn't afford a college education, or Oh, you weren't good enough for a college education. When you lessen the importance of a college education, then that mentality starts to go away.

Their entire self worth is coming from their parents because they feel like their specialty and their self worth is from there. So if they lose that parent, suddenly they don't feel like they have a life worth living anymore. I've seen this personally from children who believe that their entire self worth is derived from their parents because they have lived their entire lives with their parents and their parents put expectations on them and so what happens is that because these children feel that they only matter in the world because of their parents. In one case, once this person found out that their parents had actually been being abusive of them this whole time, they no longer felt like living because they no longer saw that their parents were actually a legitimate source of this self worth and now they had nothing left. The other case is the case of my own mother who when both of my grandparents died on that side. She fell into a very deep depression because she no longer had any sense of living besides now her children are all she has left and she says that all the time now and it's frankly depressing to me as well.

Well, in a lot of cases, especially in these minority cases that OG talks about, kids simply can't, right? There is a lot more in the way of a minority child achieving success in society than just maybe not having the belief that they are worthy of it. First of all, we think that a lot of children do believe that they're worthy of this, whether that's a part of being special or not, but there's going to be this eventual point where there's other challenges that they have to overcome, like poverty or systematic discrimination that they're not able to overcome just because they've been told that they deserve to overcome these challenges or that they're capable of it. Because in a lot of cases, this is just reality. They are not capable of overcoming those challenges, right? It's not possible for them to completely overcome all these societal barriers to their success. So eventually what's going to happen is that they realize that they're not able to actually do this.

Second of all, if we tell everyone that they're special, then no one is, right? Because everyone grows up believing that they're special. That's not unique in society in any way. So you never get this effect, any of these effects that they're talking about. Oh, a child feeling like they're special. Because again, if everyone is the same type of special because everyone's parents are telling them that their child is special, you don't get these effects because if everyone has the same level of specialty, then there's nothing special about it. Right. So you lose all the uniqueness of that speciality and the kid no longer has any reason for that speciality. So one of the biggest impacts of this is, there are some types of children who, we do need to tell them that they're special because they do matter and they are important. Like kids with Asperger's or autism, which can be reframed as super powers. You know, they talk about this, but we get that better on our side because instead of telling everyone they're special, including these children, maybe if we're just telling these children they're special because that's what they need, instead of everyone. It actually matters. And it actually makes a difference, because now, yes, these kids are special, you know? But if everyone is special, even the quote unquote normal kids, then there's nothing different about these kids. And the disadvantages show up more than their advantages. Right.

In movies, in books, in various media sources, particularly the communists, it's usually white men who are writing these sources and their identities are portrayed as the norm to which other identities are, you compare that to this standard that is a centric to to a lot of media outlets. You see this in politics as well. In Canada, in the United States legislative bodies are overwhelmingly filled with white men, the same educational and same socioeconomic status. We see their identity in the center as over-represented. So we believe that this is this narrative of them being objective just because it's seen as this overall standard. Moving into our second point of fundamentally why this is problematic. We see their experience portrayed an objective when nobody is objective, everybody is a sum of their life experiences, the interactions they have with other people in their lives, the events that they experience, their educational experiences. Everyone lived experiences and these things inform the kinds of political priorities people will pursue once they get into politics.

So it leads to a higher valuation of their experiences, which leads to better policy reform and more new wants to be, Cheryl People vote for people they think speak for their experiences. When the working class in America voted for Trump, who talked about America losing versus Hillary who would've had good policy for the working class but was seen as elitist. How does this get better at your side of the house? Well, we think that Trump got away with emotional appeals because he was seen as objective because of his white privilege and because of his high socioeconomic status he was able to talk with his issues and give out this illusion of I am looking at this subjectively from an expert opinion because of that privilege. That's not something that all people from marginalized communities get to use as a political tool. So yes. That's what we see on RSI. I said that I was on their side of the world. We have a world where people have lived, experiences are ignored while people who are usually the source of the problem that they are advocating for are seen as more legitimate because they're able to talk about these issues this passionately. If we go back to my example of racialized communities who have been brutalized by the police, they are angry about this issue because they haven't been deeply hurt by this issue. Rich, white politicians who are not hurt by this issue, are able to talk about these issues dis passionately because they don't have the same incentive to care.

Russia took that and leverage is a wave, but last, few would say that the United States is decreasingly supportive to Israel. AIPAC is poisonous and most of the democratic party runners actually support decreasing military aid to Israel. So it's decreasing the importance in the status quo that the United States supports Israel. Here's why. Even if the United States attacks, it's still okay for you as Russia. 1. You flex your muscles to the degree that you now have way more legitimacy in the region to your allies, so you have way more allies than just Israel or the United States, whatever. You secure Iran. Second of all, as I said, Iran will never make a deal with the United States, which means that you have a longterm supply of oil, which is the foundation of your economy. We are the only side that impacts that is way more important than whether America's pissed off or not. Then, we would say even if the attacks are going to happen and they're relatively bad in the short run. It's probably going to be okay in the long run. Because A, if an airstrike happens to you, it's unlikely to be like an invasion, right? It's really unlikely that the United States and gets involved in the ground and great power war between the United States and Russia. Its likely to be short term airspace, that are just temporary. That means you can probably start with that. The short term video views a little bit of economic output, but if you secure economic interdependence with Iran in the long run, that's way more beneficial to you, given that the United States would probably have to be training with you anyways. So at the end of the day, here's what you want to do if you're Russia and you want to shore up support with your allies, particularly Iran.",constructive3,5.0,prestonj,round9,prestonj_round9,0.0,

I'll start with the one that's a little bit more different. So why do we think this is very important? We think by saying that kids are special, we are acknowledging that there are different types of things that exist and there's not necessarily one right way. One quote unquote normal version one way that is better than another. This we see specifically from kids who struggle from physical and learning disabilities. By telling them that they're inherently special, it means when they automatically don't do as well naturally at school and have to struggle more, it's not telling them that they are worth less in society. It's telling them that there are different ways of doing things. People have different talents, different strengths and that they are not worthless because they are not automatically able to succeed as easily as their other students. The ideology of not saying that every kid is special in their own way, shows that there's just one way to be good, but if you say every kid is special in their own way, it shows that there are multiple ways to be good and this ideology of multiple ways to be good inherently boost kids' self esteem. It means they're important even if they don't fit the definition of normal. Now I'm going to talk a little about why this is especially important in childhood and why childhood is the key time to building self esteem. So, okay .",constructive1,4.0,rdames,round6,rdames_round6,0.0,72.0

So they are told they're special, they're told their self worth and when they see that there are barriers holding them back to prevent that, they know it's not true cause they already have this really high self esteem. It was built up all through childhood. If you do not have this high self esteem, when they encounter these structural barriers, they're less likely to be able to effectively fight it. They might be able to fight it, but they're not going to have the inherit self worth that comes from being told that you're special. They're going to feel more passionately about the right to fight for inequality because they know it is intrinsic to their self and who they are because they've been told this throughout their whole life, slightly outside of activism, we believe optimism is inherently a good thing. So when you have, in our world, when kids believe they're special and believe they can work hard for things and if they work hard, you will get it. That is an optimistic role. In a ghost world, if they say that, okay, even if we work hard, we might not get what we want, that is pessimism, we think optimism is inherently better than pessimism because we'd rather have people try and fail and try again then not try at all and be dissuaded by that.

We're saying that if you don't tell these kids about the disadvantage and you build up their sense of self worth and self esteem so they know that disadvantage is unfair and feel extremely passionate, that it's unfair and have their sense of self worth tied to how unfair that disadvantage is, they're going to be more likely to fight it and more likely to be engaged in it. And so that's my idea about optimism. Try fail, try fail, try again rather than not try at all. We think people are going to be dissuaded to try. If they know that these structural barriers exist, they might be less likely to apply for riskier jobs, riskier promotions. By that, meaning things that they would not typically get in the status quo. And they're more likely to try if they have a higher self esteem that comes from that. And even if they do fail, they're more likely to try again. More likely to get back up.

Why do you think that there are a million think tanks, thousands of really smart people paid really highly to consider what reality looks like and thousands of scientists try to determine what the pictures of reality look like?

The fundamental belief of trying to actually attempt to get to this idea of there is this fundamental picture is something that is incredibly hard. Note, that if is going to argue that stats exist, the thing is that stats are just numbers that need to be interpreted. And the way in which they are interpreted is through personal experience, is through live experience, is through contextualization, because the numbers themselves don't tell you anything. For example, dudes like Trump has a higher employment percentage than Obama and that's something told you by Republicans. There needs to be contextualization around why that number is.

Now that you believe that your view is probably the truth is probably correct that's what, for most people, what trying to be objective actually looks like. You don't realize that your own experiences, that the staff that you see, the facts that you see are still only your subjective view and you are viewing the window through a lens of your experiences still. We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right.

This is a world where you are actually better able to accept different viewpoints and actually have a more contextualization of the world in which you live in. It's a world in which people are better able to come to policies, ironically, because you are better able to come to terms with people's actual experiences. You are able to understand people's experiences more because you have no idea, no conception of trying to reach this truth because you understand that your experiences are only simply a subset of those that exist in society.

The idea that you've always had an infinite principle obligation to save the lives of your soldiers, doesn't make very much sense. Okay. So, why is Israel very restrained in these attacks right now? First, because there is some possibility of reciprocity. They say Hezbollah can't threaten Israel, because it's not a state.

Fourth, Israel is only dong these attacks in a buffer zone near the Israeli border in Syria. That is to say, Israel isn't really interested right now in poor the Middle East and trying to export the rebels who oppose Assad.

Netanyahu is unpopular because he might be indicted for corruption. The state is putting campaigns on to get more popularity, that's how aggressive and strong he is. Which is like...

We tell you in the case that they succeed, that this is a reaffirmation that they are special and that this helps give them that confidence because they've seen that they can do it. We tell you that if they fail that on our side we have a special benefit in that they think they are special, they are unique and so they can tell themselves, Oh, it's okay to fail. This isn't what I'm unique for. If I fail a Little League soccer team, which I did, then I can think, Oh, I can become, I can go into science and math because that's where I'm actually unique and I'm actually special. If they fail, if they try and they fail and they aren't told they're special, they aren't told they're unique.

But it also helps you gain the confidence to later in life try for new things. Apply to that reach school, apply for that reach job and have that confidence to actually do it. We think that this impacts all kids and it's necessary for all kids, but it is especially necessary for minorities and women, who society tells them that they shouldn't have that confidence. Society tells them that they shouldn't be achieving new things. This presents a particular countervailing narrative from their parents that they are special, they are unique. That even if society's telling you that just because you're a woman you shouldn't go into STEM, you're unique, you're special, you can do it.

It gives them the opportunity to take on larger entities, but in a larger light, it allows the decision process between these countries to be more formalized, and more centralized. In the sense that, if China decides to impose something on Singapore for that instance, Singapore themselves doesn't have to just engage with China alone. They have other countries to back them up. Whether that be financially, whether that be politically, or whether that be just another country's minds and assets in mind, because they're all together as one. So this is a positive aspect because when you have more countries working together against a larger enemy, or in this case, predatory country, you are able to better rationalize and make more clear thought decisions, which thus will benefit this country as a whole.

I think that our mechanism that we had previously been stated so eloquently, by my partner, is the idea that we want a gradual introduction of this common currency, within the ASEAN countries, which will allow a more organic, transition, from this old, divided currency, into a more common currency. This is important because countries like Singapore, and because that hard punch and a larger economic stance, do, and will realize that they may be at, in the short term, an economic disadvantage. But, in a positive light, by having this, they will understand that there is longterm benefits, because of the fact that this will be transitioned organically and will not be a complete cutoff, which will allow the longterm benefits such as... Okay, so my idea, my point here is that I'm saying, is that, when you have these countries who are larger in economic status, dealing with smaller countries, what it is, is it creates this idea of a big fish in a small pond. You have this theory that these countries like Singapore, although they may be economically secure to the other countries in their unification, what that does is, is it allows these smaller countries to A.

They're going to be more of a role model, have more say, and be able to be more involved in the whole process.

And a lot of sense that I know that opposition had talked about the prob recent evolved, but it goes more in depth than just that kind of you have to look at the economic financial consequences that would carry on through that as well. The idea here is that you cut funding off of these major institutions, you out then forced certain groups of people to have to either take these garments off or find a different place to work that allows them to represent themselves and represent their self identity. So what's their options here?

A good example was we had mentioned in the context slide that teachers wanted to be one of the largest individuals involved in this scenario. Teachers who are able to wear religious clothing, young kids who are able to see these different cultures from a young age become more accepting, remove their biases, able to from a young age grow up and see these different cultures with within a people. So if you take that away from them or if you are taking these ideas and you're taking these opportunities for these people to be exposed to this and you're taking away or only promoting more bias or stereotype stuff unfold.

1546,"the table in terms of argument. We say that there are multiple problems with not removing funding for these types of faults. First of all, we think that the removal of funding as a punitive measure is the strongest way by which governments can set precedence against violating federal laws. We think that setting this precedent is extremely important because in many cases you need top down national chains. In countries with federal systems, we give the example of Brown V Board of Education where there are many states that were willing to violate federal laws or were would have been resistance to changes in federal laws. Sorry, not at this time. And where begins in federal laws, but the change needed to come from top down because of a national movement against it. And as a result of this, we think that there was a need for a precedent of actual mechanisms by which states are forced to do things that a federal government, we think this also solved for any like edge cases of theocracies having state things because we think if there are sort of things going against existing theocratic issues in countries and the religious liberties their life, we think that these types of national movements in far as they happen will need top down change in the same way and therefore, we'll need mechanisms and precedents set by which state governments get changed by the federal instruments.  Sure. Yeah. Okay. When I know we're going over for Brown V Board of Education to happen, the North had to integrate in order to force the south to integrate. For marijuana, for example. Lots of states are against federal law. How it can be the case that federal law should always be enforced when there's no way for federal law to change unless you bought the state's experiments and come up with new, better ways to hit any laws. So first I would say that we use this as an example for when it's necessary for federal laws to force states to do something not as an example for when states doing things are actually good cause they need to be test beds for this, cause we don't think it's the case that we need test beds for religious discretion.

This is one of the most common ways you can start your drug operation or any kind of a criminal organization because they're never checked in on and the police don't go there because they're vacant.

Consumers are vastly irrational when it comes to housing in a couple of ways.

Secondarily it means that when you have that something that increases prices or decreases jobs, that just some kind of a small recession that would cause people to default on their mortgages, those people that would default on their mortgages, instead just have to move to a lower cost rental home.

But we think that it also has some emotional and mental value in what politics actually does to you. We think that your ethnicity, your social economic background and the community that you come from, et cetera and your geography that you come from are all important factors in how you argue and also the perspective that you bring to politics itself. Because we do think that on a national scale, national scope, for example, federal level politics does play a huge role differently on how money gets allocated or how the impacts go depending on the geographic geography, but also the individual like the ethnicity, the socioeconomic background you have in relation to the government who is actually making these policies itself, who's having these political debates.",constructive1,,vchaluv,round3,vchaluv_round3,0.0,73.0

But even then we think that this pushes liberal policy more towards the fact that you're going to have people who are taking into consideration these subjective accounts and these people who have actually historically haven't had the voice in these political systems, but now with these subjective measures, these anecdotal evidence, they do have more of an effect on how the politics can be played out.",constructive1,,vchaluv,round3,vchaluv_round3,0.0,73.0

We say that there is importance to having dignity and to having morality and for these people to actually feel that they do have this way, because they do have a say in the political government. So we say that the objectivity cannot cover all of these bases because we do think that if you pushed this narrative, the objectivity is the most important thing, then you aren't discounting the effect of dignity, of morality, and all these other non objective impacts that we get from inside government and all of these policies. Because we do think these policies have more impact than just the fact that you have more money, et cetera, et cetera. Because there are more impacts than just saying that there is some emotional value in taking care of yourself or saying that these politics actually matter to me. We say that the objectivity cannot quantify exactly how much this dignity matters to them and the only people that can actually quantify dignity are the people who get that dignity themselves. This is why subjective material matters. But we also say that in their world, they're talking about this idea of discounting subjective evidence. We think that this narrative that objectivity is the most important thing is what actually discounts objective evidence even more.

So even outside of the fact that if you get political change or novel, we do say, is that understanding the gravity of the situation or how it's being debated is just as important as understanding what the benefits and harms are. Because we say that the way you're being debated or the way that these communities are being talked about in the political realm is not currently how they want to be talked about. We think that you have much more ability for that community to actually change the political atmosphere and change how the political realm talks about them in so far as they are the ones who are having the narrative, having the ability to push out their subjective experiences, that they're able to have their anecdotal evidence actually used in this matter and understand the gravity of the situation. We say that finally, that the circle of empathy is essential for any political change. So we do say that, at the end of the day, the weighing mechanism you're going to be using, that the idea of the fact that even before we get any logos or we get any achievement or before we get any objective measure, what they have to understand is you have to care about the people that this is actually affecting in the first place. Because we say that the circle of empathy only relays to your friends, your family, and their closest people. However, what we hear is that from subjective experiences, you get more perspective and you get more of this idea of dignity and not impact.

They are necessarily things like welfare block grants for these police departments, your education societies, or Planned Parenthood for example in the United states. We think all of these things tend to funnel down back down into the minority system. We don't tell you there is no linkage to show an open government why this actually impacts more people. We say that the federal government actually has much more efficacy in the sense that it's much more likely to protect the minorities in the conservative society itself. So then why is it so important for federal funding to actually get to these places? We think that federal funding is important for these conservative states because there are minorities that rely more on these federal funding. We think that'll having these minorities who have a lack of access to federal resources means then that in broader society as a whole we think that they're much less likely to actually interact with... They're much more likely to be unable to actually have this economic and social mobility that is necessary to actually get out of, say North Dakota and move to New York.  We think that's much more probable on our side of the house. Where in these conservative societies, these federal funding mechanisms are the things that actually get these minorities to have some economic and social mobility on their side of the house. They have to understand that in these conservative societies that they painted themselves, that they're less likely to... They're more likely to be willing to get rid of federal funding overall. We think that means that there's... The lack of access to these federal resources means that there's a lack of access for these minorities and as a result, the impact of this is that they have less social and economical mobility and society as a whole.

We think that these minorities are more likely to be subject to more violence or more discrimination outside of that government links because we do think that the fact is that because there's mass support and that's how these local leaders got elected and that's how this bill came about. We think that this... It's much more likely that these people who have been this law has struck down, we think they're going to face a lot more backlash in two ways. One in the economic sense, we think that it's much more likely that they don't have all the access to the other companies or to the private companies or private organizations or other forms of help that they can actually access in conservative societies. But second of all, in a more direct attempt they think... I think there's going to be... It's much more likely there's going to be more discrimination towards these people when they are really wearing their religious garb. Recognize the fact that on open government the prime minister admits to the fact that there is violence in society. We tell you that that violence is going to be escalated, and so far as people are going to say, look, you're not co-opting our values. You're not integrating into society because of that. We don't think you guys are actually safe. We tell you that if the whole point of the federal government is to protect the minorities, then recognize the fact that these minorities aren't considered a society. A lack of access to federal funding means there's a lack of access to social and economical mobility. But also this also means that if we tend to strike down the state governments and the mass support that the state governments have, what this actually means is there's going to be massive backlash and massive more discrimination towards these minorities who can't move in the first place; These minorities are stuck in this area. They don't want to live in this area most of the time, but they are stuck here, which means that the... Whatever religious garb they wear, they are going to face more discrimination for it.

1294,"First off, my contention number on is that objectivity is necessary to the political process. In the United States, for example, or just Western liberal democracy in general, which I believe that we agree is kind of the scope of the debate, we can see that when we're making policy that applies to the macro level, we absolutely need to know the wide scale objective changes that are going to occur as a result of our policy. One person's experience in relation to this policy should not be something that outweighs the objective statistical values that are achieved through this policy. For example, one of the things that we're doing right now is... An argument is common in America these days, to basically say that, ""Well, there are problems with this policy because it's going to make life harder for a select few individuals."" But they seem to ignore on the other side of that policy is that it's making it easier for millions of Americans to live in a different way. I don't have a policy to specifically list off the top of my head, but this kind of emotional manipulation is used in politics. Pathos is absolutely abused across the media where they're talking about conservatives, republicans, or socialists and democrats. We can see that the pathos of an argument is abused rather than simply taking the objectivity of the options here.",constructive1,,wylywalker,round3,wylywalker_round3,0.0,73.0
1295,"I want to go ahead and move down to my contention number two, is that singular experiences manipulate the process. One of the things that we can see again in Western liberal democracy, is oftentimes we can, as the governments of Western liberal democracy, that bad decisions are made when emotions are high. We can see this time and time again throughout history. One of the examples that I'd like to bring up is countries in Europe accepting too many refugees. Now, I don't want to say that we should be accepting refugees in. It's simply that they look at a situation and they say, ""We want to help out."" Then when emotions are high, they make the decision to open their border completely. An example of this is in Germany. There are certain districts of the country that there is massive cultural clash because the Western liberal mindset of most of the people that live in Germany is clashing with a foreign culture that they're not experienced with. This isn't to say that either culture is bad. It's simply saying that the cultures are less compatible than what is ideal. It ends up becoming a massive problem because there's lot of cultural clash. Even someone like Angela Merkel, who was for the Open Borders Policy, says that she regrets making the Open Borders Policy.

1613,"essentially comes down to believing, simply, that you are purposeless in this universe, that there's nothing, specifically, unique about you. Nothing has really any meaning. And then, what do I mean when I talk about religion and when I say religion, I mean broadly religion. The belief there is a creation structure, there's a beginning, middle and end of the universe and there is, generally, purpose in the world. That's why I'm moving into my contention number one, which is talking about religion versus nihilism and a broader topic to really engage on. So, Number one, when we look at nihilism, nihilism throughout its existence as a philosophy and as a general worldview has bred a sense of purposelessness. Now, how does my nihilism connect and the sense of purposeless connect to the belief or the teaching that children are, essentially, not inherently special or different from others? Well, essentially what you see is if you teach children that they are not special or different from others, then there's going to be a central nihilism to their self understanding. If I don't believe that I am different from my partner Caleb here, then why am I going to be trying to make my own individual contributions? Why am I going to try to change my lot in life, beyond what he's ready to do? Now, I'm not saying that this belief is a right way of understanding the nihilistic philosophy, but I'm saying that this, essentially, does happen to large numbers of people when they do believe in nihilism. We can see this in nihilistic communities across the country where there is a lack of religion. It's a lack of purposefulness and a lack of a belief that you are an inherently special being within the universe, who has an ability to make special contributions to the world, one is less able to evade mental illness and suicidality. So, you can see in religious communities across the country, there is far lower rates of suicidality and mental illness. If we look at the Muslim community, Buddhist community around the world, if you look at the Christian community, we can see that there's much less suicidality and mental illness within these communities than there are in communities that described themselves to be atheist or without religion.",constructive1,3.0,wylywalker,round6,wylywalker_round6,0.0,74.0
1614,"But, I want to go ahead and talk about my final clarifying argument under my first contention and that is its overall healthier for children to believe that they are inherently special. Growing up as a child, I don't believe that I would have come to be interested in the things that I'm interested in and pursue the things that I'm passionate about, if I never believed that I was an inherently special person within this world. I, personally, am religious and I think that's one of the greatest strengths that I have, going into my adulthood is because I see that I have a track in life that I want to pursue. 
I want to follow and I believe I can make special contributions to the world. If I didn't believe that I could make special contributions to the world, I was not myself inherently special, I would have much less passion towards going what I want to go into, but I want to go ahead and move down with my remaining time to talk about my second implication or my second contention, which is talking about the broader implications. Again, when we're looking at talking about the belief of inherent speciality for children, we can see that it's much more difficult for children to believe in their own individualism and their ability to contribute as a society. If they are not taught they're inherently special, this leads to a lack of individuality and we can see that societies throughout history that have an emphasis on individuality, the United States and most Western liberal democracy as being an example. Individuality leads to innovation and progress that has been, heretofore, unseen in world history. We can see strides in equality and progress and environmental concern. A bunch of different factors are impacted by society's belief in individuality and reliance on individuality as a whole. This isn't to say that communities don't matter. This is to say that individuality is incredibly important and that's why we, as the government team, believe that we must teach our children that they are inherently special.",constructive1,3.0,wylywalker,round6,wylywalker_round6,0.0,74.0

My father inherited his house from his grandparents and the only way that I see myself, an earth's degree major, able to live and effectively contribute to the economy in the future is through the revenue and is through the capital that I obtained through inheritance.

Remortgaging increases equality through the following mechanism. You can remortgage your house through what you invest in it to invest or simply to get you out of tricky situations. For example, if you're caught up in court, what you can do is remortgage your house to help pay for very expensive law bills, which also disproportionately affect the middle class.

So the mechanism is as follows. If feelings or subjective experiences are acquired, then you gather more rich and thick descriptions of a phenomenon that consequently better inform you to make policy. There are a variety of different problems and solutions that were derived in the world and that have come out of political debates that simply could not be informed by objective fact. If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world. A very good example of this is a study that was conducted and had qualitative methods that were used, focused on subjective feelings, about what the impact for Asian American immigrants was coming to United States. And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics? And you cannot answer that question by looking at objective fact. That is way too narrow and reductionist. So instead, what was done and which effectively proves the argument that we're trying to make today is, instead what happened was interviews were conducted, shared experiences were shared, and from that, a whole rich, thick set of data came out, and consequently informed in how to better, in an informing way, of us understanding the true impact of, for example, segregation and assimilation on Asian American immigrants. Now this is a very broad example and to connect it back to the resolution, I want to talk about its impact. So the impact of this greater idea of subjective experiences and feelings provide a whole more holistic understanding of policy, and therefore are important in a debate and that's why we regret it. The impact can be seen simply, for one, by looking at the comparative. So if these feelings and subjective feelings were excluded from this debate, then we simply would not have insight into feelings of, specifically in this case and which can be seen on a more broad scale, marginalized communities.",constructive1,,zoejohnson,round3,zoejohnson_round3,0.0,75.0
1581,"So, first of all, we would like to assert that one, teaching your children that they are special, and this is through an ingrained set of constant reminding, because that is what teaching is as opposed to telling, and we must recognize that. So, teaching your children that they are inherently special is unbelievably and intrinsically linked to a Western capitalist system of thought, and system of governments. It is a way that a culture simply exists. And there are a lot of flaws in approaching it in this way. And on the closing opposition, we will vehemently argue in favor of a collectivist's perspective to better serve society over that of an individual. ",constructive1,3.0,zoejohnson,round6,zoejohnson_round6,0.0,73.0
1582,"Now, moving on to my reframing, and why a collectivist approach to a society is better than that of an individualist, and why an individualist approach is intrinsically linked to telling your children that they are special. The mechanism is as follows. If you tell your child, ""You are special,"" you are inherently telling them, ""You are unique."" And this was pointed out quite eloquently by the closing government. You are telling them, ""You're a unique individual."" And what that translates to, in turn, is them internalizing this feeling of them as an individual and applying it to their life. So, for a short list, ""I'm an individual, I am special, I am unique. Therefore, I deserve to advance my stocks in this way. I deserve to live in this community over this community. I deserve to put myself first, my family first over this community, these people, these minorities, all of the above."" And at the base level, this can be intrinsically tied to a Western individualist society, and therefore, capitalism. So for example, capitalism, we see it as based off of the individual. You can simply not refute that. An individual's own ability. And also, an individual's ability to improve things for themselves to the benefit of themselves. So, we argue instead, that ... So, clearly there is a very clear link as to how these two things manifest. And it can also be seen in the fact that if you go to a more collectivist country in the East, you go to Japan for example, you are not going to see many parents in a traditional collectivist society telling their children, ""You're special. You are unique, and you are this individual."" So basically, on that argument alone, I find that this helps believing that parents should be telling their children that they are special simply doesn't stand within a world context, which is, broadly speaking, what the government defined, and therefore, it falls. Because if you try and implement this, opposition believes, ""No, this should not work because one, you're in favor of a collectivist society, but also this could not be implemented within a collectivist society for cultural barriers that already exist and serve their own ends.""",constructive1,3.0,zoejohnson,round6,zoejohnson_round6,0.0,73.0
1583,"So, to elaborate on this, and to elaborate why not telling, to solidify that mechanism, why not telling your kids are special or unique, serves a greater social purpose and an end. And we're going to look, to support this, at a case study case example, if you will. So again, we're looking at East collectivist cultures that rely on other principles to raise their children. So for example, some qualities of the collectivist culture include the feeling of shame. And that is something that you learn from that concludes the idea of mistakes that the opening opposition touched upon. But it is also in a collectivist culture, where everything is so intertwined, it is a feeling of connection and duty of service to your community. And that feeling of service to your community, to your elders, and respecting the people around you, is fundamentally based in the understanding that you are not special, that you are not unique, and that you do not serve as an individual person within their own individual capacity. And I suspect that the closing government will try and say, ""Well, you know what? How does this promote innovation?"" And here, we say that there is innovation in Japan. And all of what opening and closing government fail to distinguish is how without saying special, they fail to effectively state why being told special is the key driver of innovation. And again, just to go over and solidify that linked about this individual collectivist kind of reframing of the argument, we argue strongly because this house is really determining, and the purpose of this discussion and this debate is to determine, ""What is the best thing that we do?"" 
And again, we see time and time again within collectivist cultures, a clearer and more strong feeling of community. And what does that translate to? What is the impact? A great social safety net, a greater feeling of community, less in-group and out-group discrimination. And on that basis, we normally reframe this argument, but demonstrate how the government has really failed to meet the burden.
