They just want to have fun, they want to eat ice cream like this that, they don't really care about the long haul and making sure they get a good career at that point. So the motivation to work often has to do with the bond you have with your parents, like making them feel happy, right? When the parent says... Speaks from a place of authority, when they've actually spent a lot of time with you and you care about them and are invested in it as a child, right? You're willing to do what your parents said.",constructive1,,123dyly,round2,123dyly_round2,0.0,74.0

1512,"compare test scores, but the differences on our side, we don't impose this metric of self evaluation where it becomes deeply ingrained by parents as per the analysis we heard in the PM of how these values become deeply ingrained and are used in self valuation later on. And also, I would say the parents have the ability to push back against this by saying that self value does not come from that, does not come from comparison. It is internal, right? This is the difference that we have for the metric of evaluation. This bar is able to be met easier on our side of the house because it is innate to them. But on their side of the house, it means you have something constantly you need to strive for in order to achieve. We'd say that being exceptional is something additional in terms of achieving happiness, as opposed to the base level we're able to receive from our parents telling us of why they value us. Not because of our performance. It puts us in a double bind of saying we gain happiness internally and from our parents if we succeed. And if we fail, we get nothing. On our side, at least we get the love of our parents. But secondly, I think parents are inflating their expectations of children and that sets a bar for happiness that is difficult and often impossible to attain. That's for two reasons. First is a talent distribution. It gets unrefuted by them, and second is the idea of structural barriers that exist. It means that children aren't always going to live up to be exceptional among their peers. This is still true for rich kids who aren't able to necessarily compete with kids at their private school and are going to be comparing themselves in that context and are able to become exceptional because their parents have even higher expectations of them than other parents may have of their different children. Right? I would say that generally this means that no kids get to actually achieve this generally or it's very hard for them to, because of the affirmation reasons I gave you. And why they're likely to succeed to a point that is comparatively so much better than their peers around them.

1513,"On to learning and development. First I think the misallocation of time and talent, is there an incredible harm to these children? Again, it sets them on tracks in which they believe that they will succeed and be special. It means that the kid who thinks he starts off in little league because his parents say ""you're special and you'll get all the home runs"". It goes in. It feels like just like an average job and never really gets to that level of where it feels special, but maybe he would have been a fantastic pianist. The world will never know because he said he was special and he's playing baseball for the rest of his life. Second is learning from peers. It unlikely you have that nuanced narrative on their to the house where they go, well, this is my special thing, but that guy I can learn from him because he sure is special in his thing. Well that's far more likely to be on our side of the case. When you tell people that they're all innately special, all have some kind of intrinsic value. It means you don't learn from the peers around you. But third, is that you're unlikely to get self-improvement because Omar tells you to blame society every time you fall, because if you don't succeed that are letting you down. If you don't succeed, then it is society's fault. At what point do you call for introspection and identification of personal flaws when the idea is that if I'm not capable of this, then therefore society must be wrong. There's no principle to guide this issue if there's no actual working to change yourself. But then fourth, is a double bind where they say that children are able to benefit from this area, receive happiness from it up the point where they rationalize it. Later on to say, well maybe this is where I could self improve. But either you get that happiness of saying I'm special all along the way or you don't because then they get a reality check and it goes into the source of saying like, well maybe I'm not special at these sorts of things.

If you are generous and good and honest, you can achieve your full potential and this potential is exceptional, right? We think that is a question about P-O-I, about whether this is an excuse for bad behavior, right? But we think that bad behavior sometimes happens, that it is not necessarily that you are able to have everything you want, but rather that your potential is really high and that you can, through work, get there. Right? We also think that we created an optimistic view of the world. Also, we think that bad behavior often gets rectified throughout... in other ways, like in the classroom, a parent's going to be like, ""Stop bragging about your brain,"" right? The teacher will say this and we think that parents teaching inherent self-esteem is a way more important early developmental mechanism. Why is this the case? We think that parents are uniquely important for socialization. Julia tells you this, but parents have a very unique control over how kids think, whether or not it's rational, right? Because we think that's why parental pressure is so disproportionately hard even when the kid... even when it doesn't totally make sense. We think in the absence of this positive messaging from your parents, kids have less wrong intuitions about what they deserve. They have internalized lower self-esteem. We think that this doesn't even have to matter because we think that kid names are often exaggerated for kids as well. When parents say you can be president if you want to, it doesn't mean they actually need you to become presidents for their own self-fulfillment, right? It's to give you an exaggerated version of you believing in yourself because... That you can achieve a lot of things, that you are really smart, that you are really capable of being hardworking and doing all these hard things. It doesn't mean that when kids are 15 they're going to still think their parents want them to be president or Mark Zuckerberg, right? But what it does mean is that they believe that their parents believe in them and that they have this self-worth, that they deserve to at least have a shot at trying to achieve these things.

1563,"Then let's talk about this issue of bad behavior. We think bad behaviors are brought up at the P-O-I as an expression of low self-esteem. For example, a lot of cases of bullies in the school yard are kids who are bullied by their older brother who then lash out at school to feel the sense of strength. We think that when parents and imbue their kids with good self-esteem, kids often don't become bullies because they feel good enough about themselves and don't need to act out or take it out on a smaller kid about how bad they feel about themselves. Also we think parents can just teach good values like a contingent potential like we talked about, how kids parents can say, ""You can achieve all these things and it's contingent upon you working hard and reaching your potential,"" which isn't just a straight path, but rather you will have to overcome obstacles. You will have to do good to other people, right? We think all of these things matter. What are the manifestations of this? We think later in life this can have important impacts, like making people be able to recognize when they're in abusive relationships. Making people understand that when they don't get passed over for a promotion because of bias within your bosses prejudice, that that's not something you deserve, that you are capable of doing better. We think that these kinds of early self-esteem issues can manifest into people caving to these outside messages if they don't have this inherent self-esteem.",constructive3,3.0,aabruzz1,round6,aabruzz1_round6,0.0,76.0

They are less likely to try and or to have just a fundamental misunderstanding of the sexes as we can see from the way in which the more educated tend to have a more egalitarian understanding.

Now, this is not always going to be a bad thing, however, it's possible that if in your neighborhood all the police wear crosses, or if all the teachers in your school are ascribed with specific religion as you can tell just by the symbols that they wear, then this will inherently denigrate your religion and make you feel uncomfortable, as you will be made part of the minority.

Because if you don't tell them they're special then why would they ever try to do anything with everything just handed to them on a silver platter. We tell you that telling children that they have a unique, intrinsic sense of worth allows them to break out of that mentality that come up from being in a privileged household.

Those things are not mutually exclusive and I think in our world telling a kid they're special but also have them do some chores around the house... Those things are very plausible and kids understand your encouragement and have them do things.

1466," So onto rebuilding of Mefreger's points. So the reality of an individualist society and where we live, and what it means to teach a child they are special within a society. So we live in a world where individual ideas and successes are the most rewarded, and thus the narrative that your child is special will help them in developing skills and ideas that are rewarded in our society. So if you tell your child that their abilities are inherently special and better than other people around them, then that means that they have an edge where they understand that they are deserving of this success. They will seek out that success and they will seek to improve those abilities to a point where they become the most special, because they believe that they are. And we think that on an individual level, this leads to the belief that you are deserving of success and thus will seek it out. When we teach children to look out for number one in a society which only, no, the only person you can look out for in our world is yourself, then we're setting them up for success and we're setting them up to be successful in a world where this is the only important thing where your personal successes and your personal rewards come from your hard work and your faults. So we tell you this, why is this important? So why do we want to teach children that they are special within this world? And why do we see that as being more important than something that may bring up saying that they just have value. So what we see when we tell children that they are special is that they have an idea of what they have to offer society that they can then apply in their lives, and that they can gain successes from.

So when parents treat their daughters like they're special and to achieve great things, then you're equipping young women with the knowledge that they have inherent value, which unfortunately under the status quo doesn't happen. We don't teach young women on a standard level that they have inherent special qualities that are different and better than the people around them. So what happens on our side of the house when you teach young girls that they have qualities that are special, that are different, that are important, is you get women more inclined to want to take on leadership positions. When you tell a young girl that she's special and thus deserving of the success of a leadership position, then she's going to want to achieve that better, she's going to want to take on that position. When we tell girls that they're special we empower them to become leaders, and why is this point so important on our side? So what we see under the status quo is, when we don't think of individuality when it comes to what children are taught, as they're socialized, when they grow up, when we don't have a standard level of teaching each child that they're special as they grow up, we don't get the same benefits when we see young women as leaders and necessary. And on the impact of young girls who are systemically undervalued in our current society when it comes to socialization as children, that if they were to receive indications from their parents that they have inherent special and unique qualities that are valuable to society, they could potentially seek out leadership positions from a younger age.

For instance, like women coming up and talking about how they are sexual assault survivors.

This bad decision making comes about because when your parents tell you that regardless of your abilities... when your parents tell you that you can do anything, you kind of internalize this idea, right? Which basically means that you can be Mark Zuckerberg number three and drop out of college and maybe have a new start-up. Something that you will actually believe because it's something that your parents pushed when you were one to five years or one to 10 years old, and it's something that's so deeply ingrained on you. This means that you're more likely to do things like take out risky loans to, for example, pay for your start-up, right? Which would lead to you being in gross amounts of debt, in the end, if that startup is not successful. Moreover, it would probably lead to you thinking that... not really engaging with the consequences of your risky behavior because you will continue to think you're special, which would mean that you would continue to participate in said risky behavior.

1205,"magnifier of these harms of these political policies
What are the harms? Threefold. Firstly, we think that this makes a loud minority deceive the majority into voting against their own interest. What government side has to support, in this case, is Trump and his fear-mongering strategy to get the majority of the population to vote against their own interest. It's things like emotionalized experiences of crime and violence that take the status of Mexican immigrants out of context and say, ""This is what they are doing."" And when people talk about personal experiences of having a crime done to them by a Mexican immigrant, that does not mean that that is a generalized truth in America in today's world, right? But it emotionally moves certain people who directly perceive this as a generalized situation. We think that this deceives the majority into voting for policies that are not right for them. Notice the bias here. Positive emotions are far less effective in the political sphere than negative emotions. At the point in which personal experiences directly focus on negative aspects of certain immigrant populations or certain minorities, we think that this disproportionately harms them, to the exclusion of others. We think that it's very hard to compare different personal experiences. That's why voters can't make an objective account in this case. The second harm that comes from personal experiences in political debate is that this pushes politicians to the extremes. That's to say when emotions and personal experiences dominate political debate, every politician is forced to engage in that. Why? Firstly, just a large perception that this is somehow more powerful and persuasive to the public. But second, they want to avoid sounding really cold and calculating, at the point to which other politicians are talking about very personal stories, where you're talking about numbers. Why is it incredibly bad? Firstly, you lose the opportunity to genuinely inform the politics and what policies each candidate stands for. Notice that publicized and televised political debates or other unique opportunities to actually inform the public on political issues and get them to be informed voters when they actually do elections. You lose this opportunity at the point in which you focus more on personal accounts and subjectivity, rather than actual facts and what policies each candidate stands for.",constructive1,,andrewyun7,round3,andrewyun7_round3,0.0,76.0

1207,"The last thing I want to say under this argument is that politicians are less likely to translate their promises into policy at the point in which political debate focuses more on personal accounts. Why is this so? Firstly, you focus more on the problem, rather than actionable solutions, at the point in which personal experiences largely serve to identify what the problem is in society. But secondly, you get less tied down by campaign promises, at the point in which publicized debates are focused less on making campaign promises and promising to the public, rather than just focusing on personal accounts and subjective issues that serve to try to move the public emotionally. Secondly, I'm going to talk about how this harms social groups that are involved. Firstly, I think you prompt the opposition parties to attack your experiences directly, rather than the policies that you stand for. There is a difference between attacking objective political preferences that you have and attacking painful experiences that are very integral to who you are. If you're a woman in the workforce who suffered from workplace discrimination or an immigrant who is refused service because of your race and your opposition party in these political debates say that your experiences are illegitimate or not what is largely true about the world, we think that that harms you personally. But secondly, an impact of that is you socially divide the populace even more, at the point in which the experiences that you as a member of a particular social group are more likely to have become politicized in and of themselves. Your party allegiance is directly tied to who you are and your identity, and that's more likely to segregate the voting population into different social groups who think that's terrible for the political atmosphere in the long term.",constructive3,,andrewyun7,round3,andrewyun7_round3,0.0,76.0

This is both biological and psychological. Because a child is born from a parent, they feel a closer bond to them than say a random person and therefore parents are uniquely key for reinforcing messages and teaching children skills. The second is just a time bond. Because children and parents spend so much time together, children obviously care more about what their parents say than any other adult or person in their lives. And the last one is that even in cases where parents don't necessarily have the resources to shower kids with gifts, some kind of verbal affirmation or verbal support from parents is very key to making sure that children do get the same similar experience as kids of a higher socioeconomic status and still get some baseline level support from parents. Our model is very simple. We advocate for parents reinforcing that children are special from an early age.

1482,"Our first argument is that it results in self-actualization and a feeling of purpose. This is a principled argument because we believe that every single child deserves the right to self-actualization and the right to discover their purpose in society. Self-actualization is at the top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and currently some children don't have the opportunity to achieve that because of a lack of verbal support and a lack of emotional support from an early age. The process that we believe results in self-actualization is simple. There's a verbal reinforcement that occurs at an earlier age. Children reinforce these verbal messages and start to understand them. When they're told that they're special, they start to feel that they're special and act in a certain way. After that, children are able to discover their purpose and their goals. As children get older, these goals get more specific and more oriented towards perhaps careers or things that they want to do to help the community. Eventually, once people discover their purpose and their goals, dating all the way back from an early age, they'd reach self-actualization, and understand that they have a niche role in society. Telling children they're special means they become special because of modeling and internalization. Children, as I said earlier, are very impressionable at an early age, so being told they're special, will likely make them feel that they're special. The reason that this is good is because it allows children to pursue individual goals. This book helps society as a whole because it means way more people will be pursuing specific goals, likely for the betterment of society, and also make sure that children of all access levels, and children of all backgrounds do get to pursue their goals and do get to feel like they have a positive meaning of life, and do get to feel like they have a purpose in life.

1483,"Our second main argument is that children feeling special at a young age, and getting more support from their parents, is likely to reduce teen and young adult suicides. The reason that suicides often happen is because people don't have a purpose to live or a specific reason to live. They don't think that life is worth living and in a lot of cases that is because of lack of support structures. They haven't had sufficient support structures from an early age, so they don't have these resources in their life to understand that they're special and they deserve to live. The impact of suicides is that tangible human lives are lost, particularly young adults. And teenagers are particularly vulnerable because when they have stressful lives and when they don't understand exactly how they fit in, how they feel special, all of these things, they are more likely to commit suicide and that's something that we think we have an ethical obligation to prevent. When we have a situation rampant in society where there's so many people largely of low income backgrounds who don't feel that they have a need in society and don't feel like they fit into society, we do have a role as any governing body or as any member of society to help them and prevent this problem from becoming any worse.

There's a big socioeconomic gap in parental support right now. Largely, rich parents, parents of better socioeconomic backgrounds are going to provide more support to their children, both financial and just time commitment. Whereas in a lot of cases poor children don't have the same resources. We believe that by pursuing this motion and specifically the model that opening gap presents, we will give all children access to this kind of verbal support. So obviously it's not the same level of financial support in a lot of cases, but it is still giving every single child that baseline level of support that helps them making sure that they have some emotional attachment to parents and these children also feel like they have a purpose. The reason this is important is because getting this parental support is important to future achievement which results in income ability for these people. So the problem with the current system in the United States and a lot of other countries is that people are stuck in whatever class they're reporting. If they were born into the lower socioeconomic class, they're not going to rise. A big part of this is obviously the level of finances that they have and also the amount of support and resources around them and we believe that obviously we're not getting, our model is not giving everyone money, but rather it's giving them support from an early age. It's really important because children are impressionable. They have to form goals at an early age and have to learn that goals are important. By doing this at an early age, we are increasing their potential for achievement and therefore their potential for income ability, which is a key impact in this round because poverty is one of the biggest problems in countries all over the world and if we have children given more support from an early age this poverty system is largely resolved.

There is a phenomenon called the ""do-good feel-good"" phenomenon. When kids feel good, when they feel like their efforts are recognized and they feel like they're special from an early age, they're more likely to do good things and do things that are beneficial to society all across their vitals. We believe that community building, particularly in low-income in communities is one of the most important things that can be done and one of the most important initiatives any government can try to do. Because if we build up these communities from the youngest generation, we have future cycles of kids trying to do achievements, kids trying to help their community, kids trying to build things in their community. That's one of the best ways to escape from an endless cycle of poverty because if we continue to have kids who don't have our pre-achievements, who don't have support structures from an early age that can lead to concrete achievements, we get communities that are perpetual ruins and communities that perpetually don't have role models.

And this just on a moral level and on a practical level, it just does not make sense. And the more that you own home ownership, what you end up doing is that people have this sort of... It's like a monopoly, and people get to own these houses, and legally nothing can be done about this. With our policy, the policy that brings to you of social housing, these homes can now be used.

Because there are very specific locations where they can own those homes, and once you have a home ownership, you are stuck there. You are trapped in that location. This removes any chance of social mobility, integrating into a different community, because this will divide homes into certain areas based on income.

The federal government is beholden to all of its citizens, because of the way it works. When you live in a democracy, you consent basically to be governed by the state and the federal government. The federal government represents people over at large and things like that that. Like this whole thing there. Right? So, if it's in the state's constitution, that means that all citizens of that state are going to be ... all that country are beholden to that constitution. It's like a set of principles that we all agree to by consenting into it. Right? I think there's just a great debate over; how do you consent to a state?

Our collective group of people are right and we're going to pursue these laws"". Right? What does this do? This looks like the danger of nullifying what federal law is. It means that when states started saying; ""we're only going to follow X, Y but we're not going to follow Z "", you start getting this question of; well great, if this state's going to follow this law, then why should California follow like economic regulation that they don't agree with president Trump, right?",constructive2,3.0,bfalkofs,round5,bfalkofs_round5,0.0,73.0

So I think it's important remember that the federal government still has supremacy in this case and it is... what they're defending specifically is on the margin, the minor cases which the federal government is unlikely to react in general. With that said, that's a bit of framing. I want to get on to two points of extension with integrated rebuttal. The first one, how this is going to use largely as a tool for dominant religions and the second on the cost to the state when this is imposed. So first, on to how this is a tool for dominant religions. Remember there are a lot of religious liberties that come at the expense of other people, for example, religious schools refusing to employ gay people, which is an issue that has come up in the United States and other developed countries, right? All the time. It is theoretically a religious liberty that a Catholic school should be, should be able to refuse employ to someone who does not align within their stated religious values. But that does not mean that that religious liberty is The specific problem is that there are religious liberties for which there was no trade off. For example, your ability to go to a church and pray, but there are other religious liberties where there's a trade off with another individual's rights. For example, the ability to, for example, the ability to deny baking a cake to a gay couple who wants to have a cake made for their wedding and that very famous case. It happened in the United States recently, but the fact is that that is not true. That religious liberties in every case don't have some other potential, right?",constructive1,3.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0
1840,"That is, that is being infringed on it because of those religious liberties. I think that they need to make the case for why religious liberties come before all other kinds of liberties that religious liberties could theoretically trade off with and not just that religious liberties are inherently good. Now, I think that there are a few specific examples of this. You can look at, for example, this Quebec law. I think it has a pretty reasonable defense in that, for example, the school teachers. Let's say there's a Muslim kid in that area and the school teacher and they live in a predominantly Christian area, and the school teacher wears a cross around their neck. That's a reminder that they're an outsider. What you want for federal employees is to, in a secular society, is for them to be able to appeal to all people around the... I'll get to you in a bit...

That's true in either world. Even if this law is put in place, the difference is that all of a sudden that person, you know the like the Muslim kid who goes to school is going to see their teacher wearing specifically Christian iconography which is going to reflect negatively. Now the next thing I want to talk about is the issue... Is specifically you can look at this as being a big deal in developing countries, right?

Okay. And so now on to the final third point here, which is about the costs of the transition and the cost of states physically. We don't get a conceptualization of whether States are likely to accept or deny this from the opening government, but we think it's likely to happen is that States are likely to put up a fight. They are likely to say fine we won't take your federal funds and they're likely to just take a hard line because these are deep seated beliefs in these people. We don't think it's going to work in the long run, but we think they're likely to take this line and what's likely to happen is that these people, these areas are going to go into serious economic recession.",constructive4,4.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0

Now this is really problematic because remember, you're punishing the people, the citizens for bad decisions on the part of the government, right? And so this is really, this is, I think the first one was the principal here, because you should not punish the citizens for the actions of the government. And that if there's a chance of them not accepting this, that they are acting people facing the consequences are not those in power, they are actually the ones who are worse off, or the worst off in society.",constructive5,3.0,bschwaz,round5,bschwaz_round5,0.0,71.0
1449," First of all, we think that there is actually a principle case here that people are actually inherently special and do have inherent human dignity. We think that there is a sentient human life and rights that specifically can be intuited by the fact that I believe that I have gotten it personally, and I can project that to others, and see that others who are similar to me use that heuristic to decide that other people have value. And basically this is very foundational to our society that generally speaking, society believes this and so reporting values that are society is going to be useful. Additionally, we think that most parents, almost all parents, will believe that their children are special. It's simply true that most parents believe that this is true, which is why this is something that parents tell their kids all the time. And we think of it as usually wrong for parents to lie to their kids, unless there's a specific reason, that it's going to harm them. So if they truly believe their kids are special, then they should say that to and to their kids. And therefore, that is going to be fulfilling that burden.",constructive1,2.0,bschwaz,round6,bschwaz_round6,0.0,74.0
1450,"the opposite, like the kid asks, ""Mom, am I special?"" and they're three and the mom says, ""No, you're just like everyone else and no one is special."" Clearly this is going to be very psychologically harmful to the kid. It is not going to be good for their development. I'll give you a at this point and it is going to often destroy their sense of self from an early age. This is likely to cause a lot of problems in their lives. Specifically, they're less likely to be socialized effective other kids if they're constantly worried about demonstrating their self-worth. We think that there's a resilience that comes from knowing that you're special because your parents tell it to you and that specifically when you interact with the world and you don't believe that you are inherently valuable, that when other people put you down, you're likely to be much more effected by this. So it magnifies those effects. We also think that specifically you can intuit. Like I said, you can Intuit that because you have dignity others have it, others have it too. And so kids are much less likely to see that in other people they're treating people around them well if they don't believe that they themselves have that dignity, which just going to be very bad. But additionally we think that specifically teaching this message is good for personal utility, because you think that meaning of life comes from the striving for things, right? So basically there are things that you want to achieve. You work towards them and you build up and you try to achieve them. Now the meaning doesn't necessarily come from achieving all the things that you want to try to achieve. Sometimes you'll fail, right? But that doesn't mean that there isn't value in striving for those things, that specifically, people generally find work that works towards a goal meaningful, like we think that things that are iterative and build upon things are generally the places that people are going to get the most value out of life, as opposed to things that are more just... You have to eat every day. Eating as enjoyable, one sound that's certainly meaningful, right? And so people are much more likely to find this meeting. ",constructive2,3.0,bschwaz,round6,bschwaz_round6,0.0,74.0
1451,"So we think that this personal utility is very important. We also think that specifically when people fail, they're much less likely to get back on the horse if they don't think they have dignity, and if they don't think they're special. Specifically people are much more likely to spiral into depression when they're... And if they were told that they were special, they will continue to fight for things, they'll thank you, even when they fail and that because they believe that they deserve better, because they're pretty working, they'll continue to work even in the face of defeat, which is a good thing for them personally because they're generating meaning and they're most likely to accomplish things despite deterrence. But the other reason we think this is important is for societal good overall. Remember, all people who do great things believe that they are special, right? There are so many innovators. We think that generally speaking one individual person or individual people are kind of the drivers of major innovations in society, right? You look at like Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla, as being great examples of technological innovators. There are all sorts of people who come up with some sort of unique idea, believe they can change the world in some way. And it's true a lot of those people fail, but it doesn't matter, because every single one of them believe. They think if they didn't believe that they could change the world, they wouldn't even try. And so it's really important to incentivize all people to think this way or else we'll never have these big innovations, we'll never have these big societal gains over the long run, right? Specifically, we think, going back to the determining failure point, that it's really important to foster these bright minds, the most important people in our society, the innovators, and to teach them this from a young age, because if they never learned it, then our society stagnates and it never gets anywhere.

When I POI'd them, just on the basis of how minorities are facing structural oppression, advocate for their safety and advocate for their rights to be promoted. Usually it's on the basis of, ""My emotions are happening right now because police brutality induced trauma on me."" or because ""ICE knocked down my door."" These structural forms of oppression are harming my safety. Usually all of these bases are on the fact that we don't have equal access to human rights as other groups out there. I think is something distinctly different from a lot of the right-wing silent majority populism that comes out of them on the basis, because you realize that the delineation of the rights that they're advocating for aren't as clear cut as ""You're infringing on my safety."" Usually it's something along the lines of ""You're infringing on my traditional values. My country isn't the same way it looked for."" It's just not as hard hitting in the courts and especially what we value in a Western liberal Democracy. But granted, this obviously would give some leeway and marginal gains to maybe anti-abortion groups and are willing to concede that on OG, that this gives a little bit of a platform to regressive ideas.

I think that this means even black lives matter. When you have someone stand up and speak about the experiences of police brutality they had, that's probably somebody that had marginally more resources than somebody in the same community to be able to want to advocate that. Why is this necessarily a bad thing? It's because it means the people who face the brunt of the oppression are never the ones on the forefront advocating for policy reform or policy change, meaning that the policy always gets whitewashed, always gets watered down, and it doesn't necessarily serve the most important urgent needs of this. We've seen this, about how the gay community prioritized gay marriage and they didn't even worry about workplace harassment and police brutality in a lot of cases.

They don't mind going through that trauma because it doesn't personally affect them at all. But why is this especially bad? Because this means that they're less likely to give sympathetic sentences to people who are actually a detrimentally affected through this conflict. I'm going to explain this later.

Firstly, especially in post-conflict societies, those with knowledge about the legal system are the first ones who are killed because they don't want resistance from them.

Firstly that you have to draw out long-term processes within the investigative committees as well.

Foreign people who have more expertise in terms of core issues are not going to be let in because people want legitimacy and legitimacy comes from people who they think understand the issue better. They're not just going to let some foreign people come in and make decisions for them. The last reason why it's hard to get enough sway is that you have to find people who are not biased, but who stayed as States themselves having the sense to promote like-minded individuals into this committee. Why? For three reasons. Firstly, they want to retain their own power. This is pretty much analysis that's given to us by inside government. This, instead of analysis. And when we say that the reason why they want to have people who are likely to retain their own powers because one, they don't want the committee digging up their own stuff, their own problems that they commit in the past. But secondly, silencing that they talk about applies to these committees for exactly the same reason. But secondly, they do this because they want to curry favor in the long-term.

Firstly, they have this thorough process that they follow through, so he can't forcibly hasten it just because you want some political means or achievement at the end.

And lastly, the government is still going to put money into these courts to establish legitimacy unlike these temporary committees. The second extension is on why we get more systematic troubles on their side of the house. Three reasons. Firstly, the government now has an excuse to not reform courts and not reform internal issues. They can just push their burden away. But secondly, the public chaos means that you have a decrease of legitimacy in the government in the short-term. So the committee has to give out fast sentences. But we explain firstly, why this is not going to happen. But secondly, if it does happen, it's going to be biased and ineffective. The last reason is that, you as the government, then don't have enough political capital after establishing these kinds of permanent temporary committees. Because one, because you have to prove the legitimacy of that. The impact of this is twofold. First, it's hard for you as a state to move forward with other progressive issues in the future. But secondly, it's hard for you to institute large scale chains and public goods, like public infrastructure. Why is this especially important?

As I said earlier, we're not defending telling the child that they're better if they don't need to try. We're saying that any child should try as much as they can because when they try they can achieve anything, because they're an individual and because they had his own potential as an individual, you should try because trying maximizes this all of these special qualities that you have as an individual. Not simply that you are better. Right. So it's necessarily true that what they say is, Oh yes, like psychologists say it's better to put pressure on them and not have them grow complacent.

1455,"  Finally, getting on to what Dennis and I substantiate. We tell you that being told your special is bad. Apply with Dennis says. First he says this is bad because family and community obligations. So I feel I'm special and I need to work hard in order to get my family out of poverty, or to continue a cycle of my upward mobility, I'm going to feel incredible pressures. Why is this bad? It's bad for my mental health. It also makes me become a doctor, a computer science major. Even if this doesn't have good society, or for myself, I'm sure there are things that I could be doing better and it makes me feel bad. Then he says these accomplishments are meaningless, because it's only if you're a family.

So you feel a greater sense of personal responsibility and satisfaction if you're completing things for yourself intrinsically, because you have this sense of happiness when you complete them. Also, they're not earned. So... As an example, I think if you get a job just because your dad gives it to you, it's going to feel much less good than if you get a job because you worked for it. And I think have it feeling better because you worked hard incentivizes you to do more work. Then we say that you get less harsh lows because you don't have any desire to improve because of no accountability Yeah. So I think recognizing being you told your specialist bad, if there's more meaningful highs and less meaningful lows... or, yeah. It's because of these reasons. But recognize the reasons we give you are not only not harmful, but Being told that you are a good person because you're kind incentivizes you to work harder, incentivizes you to be a better person. The only chance of ever actually improving yourself. It also gives you less isolation because you're more comfortable asking for help to improve yourself. You're also less likely to be an asshole to other people.

1522,"First thing I want to do is framing before I get into the first argument. Talk a little bit about what we think the world actually looks like. So let's go for the first one. We think that success in general is not a guaranteed thing. I want to establish that very clearly. There's four key conditions that we think lead to a late success in general and those are, structural conditions that is like, am I a Latino individual that is growing up in a Western country or things that you can't control. Does my family have money? There's talent and predisposition, right? My unique skill. There's luck. A lot of things are literally just a gamble. Like is it the best investment for the pitch, or is this a good place to be working? Will it actually help me. The one of these conditions that actually is directly controlled by the individual is the effort and hard work they put in. We think we best control that variable because the other variables are not limited by the individual's control, and this is going to become emphatic as we go. The thing I want to highlight is why being special is inherently the relatively special. That is, if everybody is special then nobody is special. A coin is special because it stands out, because it's unique. It has something that is comparable to others and therefore we can assign a value of superiority. We don't necessarily think that children should have the mindset of superiority, like explain them all these arguments. But essentially, if you don't think they're special, you inherently have to be superior to others or stand out from others in some capacity",constructive1,2.0,idonotad,round6,idonotad_round6,0.0,74.0
1523,"The next thing I want to talk about is how this is linked to the expectation of success. So if you have been told that you're special, but essentially because you're superior, you must pursue some sort of grandiose achievement, right? This is what people are conditioned to think. That we must become doctors or lawyers or politicians or whatever society they grew up in determines the definition of success. Not necessarily what they sell to sign something that they preferentially would like to do or something that they find more interesting. So as that is clarified, I want to talk about the first argument that have I've both dealt with it, because we think we want to ship success or standard success and our self-defined version of success or somebody defines their self-worth based on what they want to achieve and whether or not they achieve this, right? We think two things of this. First of all, you break from the societal expectations that you need to do some sort of societal contribution to be successful, right? So essentially that means that you can assign some of the things that you enjoy to your own success and apply the only variable that really matter, and that is hard work and that is determination and that is effort. You'll actually develop your capacity within those fileds, right? You might not be doing the most talented thing, but if you really enjoy coding, then by all means go ahead and practice because practice makes perfect at some point, right? My partner and I are [dead at this room 00:00:02:41] but we still want to keep going because we enjoy how much we're growing. Maybe we're not predisposed, we're not world champions already, but just keeping going is enough for us to learn enough, right? So on that basis we think it's really important, the personal choice and preference as we considered, right?  ",constructive2,4.0,idonotad,round6,idonotad_round6,0.0,74.0
1524,"The second thing I want to consider here is the idea that this is personal choice. And they talk a little bit about that, messed up the distinction, but I think that's pretty clear. Next thing is clearly the idea of how you evaluate effort as the basic thing. So if my child is being told, the way you become successful is through effort, not because you're special, then when they see somebody who can be successful, they will admire the effort that was being put in and they will therefore try and emulate that behavior. We think this role-model behavior... Like if I see somebody become successful at something that I'm interested in, I will try to work just as hard so I can be in that position because I will assume that their position is because of that effort. Even in the case that it is not because of effort and it's because a preexisting conditions, we think that the inspiration of effort is sufficient in a second. Right? So what's more is that we think that effort will be understood to be inherent for success. So we have ways, the generalization of conditions that lead to success. So what she talks about is that you can be successful and that in school you should go and try. Well we think this kind of school, the conditions that led to your success other than hard work and effort tend to be generalists. Right? So we've had to overlook whether somebody has any sort of privilege or any sort of wealth, in favor of the clear fact that they're successful. We tend to disregard those factors. In this world, right? If somebody fails to become successful, we actually become critical of why they did so. If they actually ended up putting in the work and they're not successful, we're actually critical of the conditions that failed to put them up there. So maybe more critical of race relations or gender relations and how they failed to put some people into a position of success or critical of wealth disparities and how they failed to put people in positions of success.
 ",constructive3,3.0,idonotad,round6,idonotad_round6,0.0,74.0
1525,"So let me go ahead and talk about the second point that I have for you. We in general think two ways of this. First of all we think it's not the higher fees because when we assign success to a self ascribed position of success that is not necessarily being rich and famous but maybe just finding a thing you really enjoy, if you just want to be successful. You are living alone and having a garden. That is a definition of success if that makes you self sustaining, right? But essentially at that point where we think we inspire people to make their own individual hierarchies rather than hierarchies related to society, like it's no longer an assignment. You have to be better than everybody else. [crosstalk 00:06:01] share because we think capitalism is inherently hierarchical and that means that you get to disassociate from the hierarchies and therefore find value in your own personal choice and your own personal effort and your own personal work. We're all going to think that should you fail at something at anything then that will hurt your confidence as well. You don't need reaffirmation on something that you're bad or should not be doing. Rather, we think is that it actually helps you find the right position.  So your child, you're experimenting different fields, like maybe I'm interested in this thing and you figure out that you're not necessarily as good at it. You might want to try something else or maybe you can go, ""I'm really into it."" So if you're into it and if you fail and if despite failing, you keep going and you may eventually reach success, we think that this is much more rewarding and much more fulfilling. So essentially what we think is that this creates a position where you can empathize with other people that have dealt with hardship and therefore are more likely to evaluate setbacks and associate with other people that have had setbacks.

So when you start using hate speech, mainstream politicians are not going to be automatically. Let me talk about minority narratives. Let me talk about these ideas that they see themselves as fringe. What happens is those narratives just get more excluded because the subjectivity that people are most strong about is going to be this idea of the language that is more racist, more homophobic, and even if you do find their point, that there happens to be a greater impact of minority voices, the amount of hate speech that it incites from the other side of the amount of racism or homophobia or sexism, but then incite. Is it going to be more helpful? You're going to get politicians that are more likely to be populous, more likely to be Democrats that will lead from backslides of the democracy into authoritarianism. We tell you this is especially dangerous in countries where you don't have the same sort of free speech for hecklers and stuff. The language used mattered. You are able to talk and have discussions about what minorities think is important through policy decisions, not just focus on these pleased emotionality. Also, remember that when people focus on that subjective experience, they only focus on their subjective experience and not the subjective experience of others. They will be so stuck in the echo chambers that they won't even be able to see the other side. So let's talk about conservatives. Oftentimes we think they're angry and they miss the nuance of policy because they're stuck in their echo chamber as well. We also think moderates feel excluded when only talking about exclusion. We all know that there is a silent majority that doesn't get their voice heard because they feel that they don't fit into either of the echo chambers. So we get more sustained coalitions on our side of the house. Think about an issue like healthcare. A lot of the nuance about healthcare is not focused on the values of either side.

In particularly homogeneous minority areas in urban areas, public education is very poor due to the fact that these areas are labeled rough neighborhoods because of increased police presence due to the racial homogeneous of the area.

I've never seen you in my life. I didn't go and rape and murder your family."" That brings a lot of emotional trauma to victims. And as a result, they don't want to go and face that, especially under the pretenses that they know that prosecution is a 50/50 throw in the air.

All of that is judgment and analysis from our opposition, that was never really engaged with your proposition.

Because you're talking about children under the age of 10 who are dependent on whatever their parents say, who are dependent on every sense of direction that their parents provide to them. And this is something that we also ask them in a BOI. We started off with saying that, if we encourage these mistakes, we are going to, in some way, you're going to relate or convey this message that they are inherently special. But we think that team government is trying to confuse positive reinforcement or encouragement with just inculcating the core ideas of someone being distinct, someone being special, which is the core of the debate. Because normal encouragement, ladies and gentlemen, is something that happens in the day to day basis. Telling a child, ""Okay, all right, you can try this next time."" It's not necessarily making them feel that they are inherently special. When there's a child who isn't playing well in soccer telling them that he is a good soccer player. But there are just external forces that aren't allowing you to be as successful as you can be. You think that is something that makes them feel inherently special, telling them that ""it's not your fault, but it's society's fault."" That it's society's fault why you're not as successful as it should've been in the first place.

1708,"First of all is the idea of what the parents role in the upbringing of the child is. The parents role is to make sure the child feels secure, the child feels safe and it's their responsibility to make sure to protect them from all sorts of harm: psychological harm, physical harm and mental harm. And we're going to show you how, in this model the children, when they grow up, are harmed in all three of these ways. Because what happens when you can bring this message that they, this child are inherently special, we see that there is a rise of community: a community of Incels. Find all those nice guys who grew up, the Intel's who grew up thinking that they would have achieved way more, but the way that lashed back out at the community is like something that the community faces a lot of backlash from. We think this is one of the major drawbacks of this policy. But secondly this idea of entitlement When you're telling the child from the very get go they can achieve a lot of things in the future, there is a sense of entitlement. They feel that they are entitled to greatness. They feels that there is inherently special about them and we feel that it leads, at least we feel that it can also narrow the horizon of what a child itself can do. Making decisions by themselves. If you like, we feel like this the parents putting the children to a specific track, which children often feel pressurized to be something or to do something before that",constructive1,5.0,kamilaslam,round6,kamilaslam_round6,0.0,76.0
1709,"But at the same time we think it's a parents responsibility to make a child more aware of their surroundings. It's the responsibility of a parent to tell the child that he is not doing well. We think that that is also very important when you're upbringing the child because you can put them in a protective shell. You can provide them this false sense of security and validation for the rest of the life because then that validation is something that they become dependent on. Then that false sense of security is something that they rely on afterwards as well, and once, when they grow up and don't have two parents to sustain or channelize their energy or need for validation, that is when they start lashing out. And then the idea is like, we don't think that the debate is necessarily about the mistakes necessarily made. We think it's more, we don't think it's really about the mistakes that you're going to make because I think that mistakes, in either case, we think that children should have encouraged to make mistakes, but in no way in our model are we discouraging or disincentivizing children to go out and make mistakes in which way they can better improve themselves. What we feel is that in our, in our model, when we have parents better telling children what they can do and better informing children how they're performing and being more sincere with them, We think that idea of sincerity also make sure that the parent child relationship is sustained.",constructive2,2.0,kamilaslam,round6,kamilaslam_round6,0.0,76.0

Because afterwards we think it can result in distrust between the parent and children, which is something that we see even more in day and age. Where children lash out just because of the false promises that the parents made on behalf of them, the false conviction that they set for them. And when the children go to achieve them, they feel like they have been betrayed by the parents and feel like that sense of being, the fact that they feel like they had been lied to is something that no children has to go through, for all this",constructive3,3.0,kamilaslam,round6,kamilaslam_round6,0.0,76.0

This is why we give you the very specific argumentation about what the society in which we were growing up looks like. So, I want to explain that first. Rich kids have the world arranged around them and to suit their needs and their interests. They don't need to be told that they're special because their living experience tells them that they themselves are special. They are more deserving because they have individualized attention. Because you have your wealth, you have the wealth and concentration of power and sweat. Did you grow up with everything arranged to your liking due wealth due to society being structured in your interests, the institutional arrangements? It's quite natural for you to think that you are in fact special. What they fail to contend with though is that the vast majority of children do not grow up in this way. The vast majority of children grow up in underfunded schools. They grow up in underfunded neighborhoods who are lacking opportunity and they don't have a meaningful way to improve their life chances. This is why we say that parents should tell their children that they are speciaL. That in the face of all of this they are special, they deserve dignity, that they too are able to achieve whatever it is they want to do. So, our argument is that given the existing structural arrangements, because children are systematically told they do not matter.

I went to preschool from a local church that my parents weren't even a part of it because the society knew the importance of having children learn skills.

When we're looking at minorities especially, as my partner brought up, there's this whole often-quoted, right-wing idea of 13 percent where they say 13 percent of minorities commit 50 percent of all crimes. And they use that to justify a lot of different, very harmful, policies to others. And they're using that under a very objective standpoint that yeah, this does happen. It does. They're able to use numbers and hard facts, which, under this current narrative, people way higher than they do exploit lived experiences and emotions in order to justify very harmful policies towards minorities like Chris, which, under Bloomberg in New York, he said that, ""Oh it's reduced dramatically, so it's a good idea,"" even though it's actually has led to more victimization of people who may be innocent of minorities. And you can see that what's happening is: focusing solely on data, or even just placing a higher emphasis on data and these objective numbers and percentages and facts, are able to be used as a guise by bad actors in order to actually harm those who are most vulnerable in a society. And what we're saying is that in total, what's going to happen is that this is going to negatively impact policy-making as a whole not only for minorities, but for everyone because of this apparent subjectivity of a human experience. So what happens is that objective policies are not really objective whatsoever because everyone has their own situations and affiliations and biases. And what happens is people are able to hide these biases under this horrible objective ideology and be able to interpret the data that they either collected or are given in order to fit their own world view.",constructive1,,ksbrown,round3,ksbrown_round3,0.0,71.0

They would say you should sympathize as criminals and you shouldn't sympathize with minorities as much because they're more likely to commit crimes on our side. You should focus more on empathy and on the human emotions of individuals and have that be higher-weighed over top of political discourse and debate, the numbers of which can often be skewed and interpreted according to one's own biases or moral views. You see it... you saw it in the eighties in the nineties a lot of crime think-states that come out and push a lot of studies, a lot of data, as important, political think-tank censes to create objective ways to sort of filter their world view through a political debate. And what we see is that what these things are doing was creating studies and economic policies that were seen to be objective and scientific that instead of pushed sparkle policies like Progressive Tax Policy, ""freakoconomics"", ""stop and frisk""... All these harsh-on-crime, broken windows ideas that are in actuality very harmful to the emotions and the lived experience of individuals under this guise that is, instead, a very objective sense of policy, and that the facts are never wrong and that instead we should, that we should focus on these facts instead of the actual emotions and lived experiences of individuals... Because what's happening in politics, and the whole impact of politics in general, is going to impact not only human beings in, well let's say, economic wealth and everything, but also how they live their lives. And when we look at how people live their lives, it's heavily impacted by their mental state and their emotional system. So what's going to happen under the side of the status quo and this current narrative that we're writing, what's already happening is that people are losing their sense of humanity.

I believe that what happens instead is that uninformed citizens can be a lot easier manipulated by data because under this current model, data is seen as a high standard. So when you have different news sources pushing, there own interpretations of data that might not be correct, there might be bias as data can often be, data is not, in fact, unbiased. There's different ways to study. Uninformed citizens are going to end up being informed by that and that, moreover, how their neighbors are actually living their lives.

Worse by the model presented by OG and CG than under any sort of status quo, or any sort of model in which we actually try and create more realistic expectations for children and aren't saying that they are especially unique and special and that is an inherent part of them that they were born with.

You look at the other individuals in this worldview, because kids, even if they're not rational actors, they are impacted by how parents say they're not stupid. I don't think anyone's kids, children are inherently stupid and don't understand what their parents are saying when they say they're special. They don't either think people are special and there are other ways which might be positive or negative or they think those are the only special treatment. Yeah. We think that if anything that does make sure that your ego is enhanced. I can't speak to you as an individual. I don't know you very well. But what's happening is this is enforcing this ego, and you know your parents might want to say, Oh, you know other people did well too. Kind of humble you if you anything. If parents actually wanted to make sure their children were well developed. I can't really talk too much more about that. But essentially what we're saying is, yeah, that's going to create this inflate ego and this superity complex and in the, as it does in the status quo, as it does to lots of people. And this does lead to a lesser ability to empathize and socialize and later in life when you're a developing human being, you need to be humble sometimes and feel humility and feel as if you're part of something greater than yourself as opposed to just being an individual.",constructive2,5.0,ksbrown,round6,ksbrown_round6,0.0,75.0

Because when you lift up students or even as children a lot, when you know society eventually knocks them down, they're going to have a way larger fall under OG's model. And we've already talked about how they're either going to, they're basically going to see this as innate to themself, that they are innately failures. Because under the system it's all about how the, you're special, you're inherently special and all everything you do comes from how you were born. No thank you. I already answered that POI. So what happens instead is that they are going to blame it on themselves and not feel as if, Oh, should work harder or I should, should maybe limit my expectations.

And what's going to happen is these parents are actually going to make their children resent them later in life and there's going to be a bigger breakdown in the family values. Because, yeah, essentially, after these great falls, these children are going to realize as even brings up that society is not what the parents said they are and that society is teaching them that it's tough, it's a horrible world out there.

1428," In my first point of constructive, I'm going to give the proof why that's wrong. So, moving on into that first point, which is the nature of political discourse. Politics is uniquely positioned because it inherently benefits off of emotional manipulation. Political debates are won by getting more people to your side, not through actual policy, but through the manipulation of emotions. What are some examples of this? The frequent demagoguery that we've seen in recent years where people win elections and win debates simply because they can get up, shout the loudest and make people feel scared. That is emotional manipulation to the highest degree, where you go on stage and you say, ""These people are coming for your land, these people that are doing this."" That is using emotionality and subjective experiences to instill fear in a populace in order to make a political gain. That's the inherent nature of politics and governments' work. What else does this mean? This means that... The use of emotional values in debate increases the political divide because you no longer have objective disagreements with people, you also have subjective disagreements. You disagree with them on points and then continue to disagree with them as their existence as a person, precisely because your fears have been stoked and they have been cast as the enemy. That is textbook use of emotions in politics. That's why we have such a heavy divide in areas that have two-party systems because the narrative is not, ""Oh, well, we just have some political differences from them. Objectively, they're wrong, we're right."" The narrative is, ""They're wrong, they're coming for our humanity."" That is not okay.",constructive1,4.0,ls5871,round3,ls5871_round3,0.0,74.0
1429,"values that have some effect on society and Gov's world, but you're not actually talking about the mechanisms that are deeply affecting your life and that is an inherently dangerous situation to get into. Now I'm going to move into how politics exists in our world. In the opposition's world, politics exist as pure civil discourse. The ability to say we are debating about policy from an objective standpoint where we can look at the mechanisms of the decisions we are making, without being blurred by emotional ties. What does this do? The actual ethicacy of political split discussions increase, because people are actually again talking about the mechanisms that affect their daily lives rather than saying, ""well you know this is really emotionally dear to me and that's why it's important"". They can also say ""this is important because if we don't pass comprehensive healthcare reform, these four things are going to happen or these four things are not going to happen"". Also, if not fettered by emotionality may... [Inaudible 00:05:40] , it's progressed a lot further. We've all seen footage from the Senate floor for example, where the people are just shouted down because they say something inflammatory to the other side that is actually trying to talk about real policy. This is again another way in which emotionality suppresses truth. This also reduces the dramatization of politics. When people are actually talking about policy, you don't have these issues of these figures coming out and saying like, ""Oh, we're going to do this. We're going to do that. You should fear this group because I need to go into power"". It stops the political circus. And because emotionality is removed, actual informed debate occurs. And because of this, policy which is the end result of political debate, works better. You actually walk through the mechanisms of each policy, which means that the policy is actually implemented in a way that reflects not only the debate, but also reflects the actual needs of the mechanisms. And saying that, ""Oh, well, you can still have that with emotionality"", just frankly isn't true because there are many times where people get up to support a point only because of an emotional tie to it. And for all of these reasons, I am proud to oppose.",constructive2,,ls5871,round3,ls5871_round3,0.0,74.0
1844,"So, talking about the status quo. The status quo, this is a world that constantly puts people down. Everyone is told that the only value that they have comes from production, and no one is made to feel special, especially not the children. And the reason why it is manifold, children don't have any real agency. So in a productive capitalist society, they have no inherent value. That is the rhetoric of the status quo, is you only have value in so far that you produce. But this is inherently wrong for two reasons. One, it makes people feel less human. When you're told that you don't have value because you don't do something that is good for society, that shame, you feel inherently bad in that moment because you've been told that not only are you not possessing value, that society doesn't consider what you consider value true even. And then, the further extension of this is that this makes people treat others as having less value. Because if you don't think that you're special, how can you think that another human being is special? How can we say that someone else has intrinsic value within their life, if you can't even believe that about yourself? And that is what is especially important in this motion. And in the status quo, where this anomaly falls upon most, are children of marginalized communities. Because in many societies, especially societies that fall strictly on ingroup, outgroup lines, there is part of an internalization of society saying, ""You don't have worth"". This has been addressed sociologically for years when dealing with interdynamics between disparate communities in the United States. Where the problem arise from is children are not told that they have inherent value by the society, especially not marginalized children. ",constructive1,4.0,ls5871,round6,ls5871_round6,0.0,74.0
1845,"However, in the government world, you are taught by your parents... And this is bringing me into my second point of constructive, about the role of the parents. And the reason why this burden does fall on the parents, is the role of the parent is to provide a good life for your child. I don't think anyone here is going to argue against that. But part of a good life is your quality of life. Being a parent isn't just about making sure your kid makes it to the next birthday. It's about making sure they enjoy their life and are settled for life, even after you're gone. Part of this good life that we want children to have, is valued in yourself. And that's what this house would do. When parents teach their children that they're special, they begin the process of learning about self-esteem and learn that you can actually value yourself not along someone else's metric, but along your own metric. What does this look like? As you gain self-esteem, which I think anyone who's done public speaking competition can tell you, it plays into your confidence. If you think you're a shit speaker, you're not going to be as confident going up to the microphone. But, and this doesn't... Obviously it doesn't just apply to politics. But, when you have self-esteem and you gain this confidence, it actually makes the way you interact with the world easier on you. If you're confident, if you're not racked with anxiety because you feel like you don't have value in a specific field, you're going to apply yourself more to that field. And you're going to have a more intense interaction in that field because you can let your guard down. You feel safe in what you're doing.

I'm sure everyone's heard of the phrase, ""Don't do something for free if you could get paid for it"". But that's actually an important phrase because what that's saying is, you have a skill that is valuable. But if you consider doing it for free, you're saying that you don't have the Therefore, someone is directly exploiting. They're abusing your goods and your services with no remuneration for you.

594,"The first argument is that ... Okay, on our side, a more objective, fact-based political debate will lead to a more productive political debate. Because let's realize that the aim of a political debate is to realize what causes should be enacted, and how our socio-economic problems should be solved through politics. And that is not simply happening in the status quo. Because the problem is that we have no idea what to do with either of our problems. And the reason for that is because we all appeal so much to the emotions, politicians don't care about solutions. They don't even present you with solutions. They use a lot of rhetoric and rhetoric, that is the problem. Rhetoric should not be ruling our political sphere.

Okay, I think also what's going to differentiate us from our front half is we're going to talk to you about practical worth. They talked to you substantially more about principles. Okay, let's talk about kids who are constantly reinforced when their children... When kids fail though some of this came out of my reputation. So any note, when parents constantly have to reinforce that their kids are special or good, whatever conception you take. Often this leads to things like parents paying for extra tutors, extra lessons, shit like that. I think as a consequence of this, only certain kids actually achieve what the level of success or goodness that government talks about and I think this perpetuates a systemic issue of inequality in education.",constructive2,2.0,maiyawerba,round6,maiyawerba_round6,0.0,75.0

I think this leads to things like, ""oh I can drunk drive I know it's dangerous but it won't affect me. I can try drugs, I probably won't have a bad reaction because I'm special so I know it won't hurt me. You think that you're exempted from the rules because you're special. Okay. I think that also when you fail uniquely when you're a child then, that negative reinforcement is happening at a critical age when you're really vulnerable so it's substantially more likely to meet things like depression and self harm. I know I'm talking about this on the individual scale but this literally affects millions of children. That's the biggest actual tangible impact you've seen in this wrong is millions of kids getting depression, self-harm just because their parents told them they were special instead of just telling you that he should try their hardest. What about when your adults? God damn, I did not manage my time well. Okay. So when your adults, I think that you contain this kind of risky decision making, it just happens in different ways. I think it leads to you saying ""I'm going to drop out of college cause maybe I think I can be Mark Zuckerberg. I know maybe... contending with government's conceptions is not really the best, but I'm going to try for it"" and then you drop out of college, you take out weird loans to do your startup.

Not by the god himself or herself but by specific people in the religious institutions such as churches. What is the value of this? We'll tell you that these holy texts and their interpretations will necessarily contain contradictory narratives. Why? Because they are built over a long time. Literally over centuries by people in different social positions like different countries. So they're necessarily going to be some clashes between values and between what's right and what's wrong in different situations. Now, what literally happens in our world with polytheistic religions is that gods are seen less as beings, as the specific person, or animal, or being that lives somewhere but more as representations of these values, right?

So you don't necessarily have to be a hardened 100% believer in order or engage in discussions of morality with believers, right? You can simply believe in the value rather than its representation by the god or goddess and you can openly speak and you can come up with a standard morality. But the second and crucial thing, is that we get the higher quality of discussion on our side. Because once you get on the opposition's page is that if you are a Christian you have to be against abortion. It's just essentially the argument used by sections of the religious clergy because they believe they have this monopoly of truth.

We argue that early childhood care creates a positive feedback loop because children who have early childhood care, have the greatest ability to engage in... Have the greatest ability to learn material later down the line because of increased care and attention that they're given as children. We think that these strong resources that they've been given early and they're carried through to later parts of your life, which results in increased preparation for college and increased success when they're in college. A couple subpoints to this argument. So first... So our Subpoint A is that we can add readiness, we can have readiness after early childhood care is incredibly important, not just when students enter college, but also leading up to college. So throughout the entire primary and secondary education system, we also think that the educational benefits that they gained in early childhood education accrued through those years as well. So we think that early childhood education affects all 12 plus years of education. Subpoint B, this argument is that we think that it's definitely key to the arguments that we think that early childhood education increases children's' financial ability to take out debts or loans to subsidize post-secondary education if needed because students will have greater abilities to engage in jobs or financially plan if they have early childhood education because of the educational benefits accrued through primary and secondary education. Subpoint C to this argument is that post-secondary education such as trade school or community college aren't super expensive per student. Which means that aren't super expensive per student compared the price of early childhood education.

Because the price of community college slightly increases students will also have the greater ability to financially plan or more financial literacy in general if they have access options like early childhood. So now our second independent argument is that we think that our model closes educational inequities. So we think that in educational inequity, speaking at an early age for example, studies show that differences in vocabulary with standardized testing abilities start as early as early childhood care and that differences in early childhood care or the amount of time that gets spent as ages lead to differences later down the line.",constructive1,,meganwu,round2,meganwu_round2,0.0,76.0

Moreover, the parents who call hopefully don't have to do that much to support their students, but the parents of toddlers or young infants have a ton of burdens to fall on them. For example, they have to have the burden of starting a career, raising a child, and possibly taking care of their own parents and that ways, which means that support for a parents accrues exponentially in the longterm as well.

We think that doing otherwise would conflate church and state because when governments impose preventative rather than laissez faire rules on religious liberties, we think that those governments in doing so are imposing judgments on religions.

We think that those value conflict over those laws have created religious tension as a result of conflating church and state. We think that laws that violate religious liberties generally, they backlash these laws, which spills over, beyond just the application of those laws. We think that the nature of religion is something that can unite people, which means that if a group of people receive the law as being sort of discriminatory or unjust to the group that they sort of operate within, then that sort of motivates backlash.

Therefore, this means that these laws are usually also racialized in nature and indict certain countries in different areas of the world, which we do want to maintain good relations with. For example, laws against Jewish religious practices will definitely strain the relations of countries with Israel. And laws against Muslim headgear, for example, will definitely strain relations with the primarily Muslim countries.

You're losing welfare programs and Planned Parenthood",constructive1,,mnjanse,round5,mnjanse_round5,0.0,75.0

If I'm a person who is not a religious minority, but maybe I am still a single parent, and I have to go through welfare programs to support my family, and now my welfare program has been cut because we lost our federal funding because of religious minorities, who am I going to put the blame on? We think the problem then, is that religious minorities become the scapegoat to a lot of people being really upset that they've now lost their federal funding. We think that increases the discrimination that [Aneesh 00:03:14] tells you towards religious minority groups.",constructive2,,mnjanse,round5,mnjanse_round5,0.0,75.0

The difference now is, if you're getting no federal funding, any sort of funding they have, now they're going to prioritize towards what they can when you have limited funds. So, if I'm a Conservative state, and now I have limited funds from private sectors or whatever the money's going to come from, now I have to prioritize it towards what I want. And if these are Conservative states, they're not going to go to things like welfare. They're not going to go to things like Planned Parenthood.

We're not a theocracy and this is not going to make us into one. This is actually going to lead us toward being a more secular state that is not based on religion. Especially when in Quebec, Christianity is the dominant religion, it has been for a long time. So this is actually over proportionally representing the dominant religion, and putting other smaller groups of religions after us. ",constructive1,,mpoot,round5,mpoot_round5,0.0,70.0

It talks about crosses, it talks about hijabs are just the example used in the motion, but it also includes all religious freedom, so it's not like it's saying ""Oh, Christians, you're fine to wear this, but the Muslims, absolutely not."" So it doesn't just discriminate on that, so it doesn't just discriminate against certain religious groups, and it actually helps groups who are in a smaller position because what it does...so it removes religion from specifically from provincial employees. So these are people who are being exposed. They're usually in government positions, they're teachers, they're federal, they're provincial employees who work in the government. So these are people who have massive impact in the way that our society runs which we do not again want that to be based on religion. Teachers are literally...they're in a position where they have massive influence on the people the students that they are teaching. So what we don't want is from a very young age to expose them, to just especially when you're in a place where there is a dominant religion, to what religion. If we have a bunch of teachers who are all religious and they're all Christian, that's not that they expose people, and I think it actually forces religious view on something that should be a secular thing, like school.

For example, the Quran makes accommodations for women who just cannot work jobs. Like for things like if they can't work with it, that is specifically in the Quran. If you cannot work with a hijab, then you do not have to wear the hijab. That means that religions make allowances for these things so it is not a complete violation of your religion because there are accommodations that can be made. And finally, remember that they punish the victims as well by making the burden fall on them when federal funding is taken away.

You have a smaller body of people, so therefore your vote has more impact. We say the people of Quebec know far better what is important for Quebec than these federal bodies because they are far more distant. They have the cultural differences, and it's just a huge group of people you are counting for the interests of a much smaller group of people. We say that the federal government does not have the right to decide of the interests of Quebec specifically.

1324,"brain development. These formative years, zero to five scientifically show that this is when children gain literacy and awareness, both socially and academically. Those are both very important. We will get into those how they differ and how they're both necessary. Studies actually show a lot of universities have researched that these years are way more formative and lead to greater success, when kids have an education that's stronger in years zero to five than later. A lot of people have done studies about it actually. You can look it up. Why is this? Why, why? I could just say for the years that studies are showing, but why don't aren't they showing, because they develop social groups. Imagine you're an only child and your parents. You're an only child so you don't have other kids to be around and play with. You're growing up and you don't really know. When you're going to this earlier education socially, this is where you gain your social footing. So you learn how to share, how to be respectful, how to care for others, what a friend is. Because at home if you're not having this education, what are you supposed to do? These things carry on the rest of your lives. The higher education gets more specific and specific and specific it gets; how to make a friend. How do I know? How do I have respectful conversation with other people? Those are things that we have now, and I use every day, but I developed when I was younger and that's what builds the emotional intelligence.
But in addition to emotional intelligence, we think academic intelligence is great too. You learn to walk, learn. Teachers at a young age can make learning exciting. You're not going to be, sometimes when you get older and older, learning is you're going to class and you're like, ""Oh, whatever."" But these kids are still excited. They're still in their earlier age. I'll take you in one minute. Where they will be excited about learning and teachers can do that. These are equal in importance. Having the emotional intelligence, the academic intelligence. Why does more funding help with this? Better facilities for these kids can pay for better teachers who have more training and more education. That's the financial end. ",constructive1,,mswan,round2,mswan_round2,0.0,71.0
1325,"the only education you're getting. This is something that's really critical. We must invest in the education that everyone is getting. If, let's just say 100%, 95% of the population gets primary education and past primary education, globally speaking, a small percentage of the world actually continues on that.
Let's just say I know, hypothetical. Let's say 50% of people do. But if you're investing in primary education, you are literally helping the most number of people because more people do primary education than anything else. So you're investing in the most amount of people, which is great. In a lot of countries, you go to primary education and then you go into work. These skills that you learned in primary education help you with, those are the ones that are critical to working. If you have specific skills you can learn them in job training and stuff like that. But, I have to say that these secondary education doesn't really have the big impact on how to communicate and how to cooperate with others. It's critical and getting into financial, because the whole thing, it's why would you vote for more finances? In the other countries for example, like Africa.
Students need uniforms to go to school, they need uniforms or they need books and sometimes those things are requirements. You need a uniform to go to school, but this is really hard on families with low income so this helps ease the burden and make sure that everyone gets to the same place, starts from the same place. I'll take you in 30 seconds. In these schools, if two kids have to share a book and if then you don't have textbooks for all the kids, then they're only going to be getting half the assets to these things. And that's critical because at these early ages, kids are still learning how to learn and if they have their own materials, they're going to be more excited to do that. And that means at home. When the kids go home after school and they're having their work with them. If they're able to afford the books to bring home and study, they're going to develop a love for that.

Parents might be dead, they might get incarcerated, they also just might not be present and invested in the education. But if we can invest in this, teachers are role models for these kids. You look up, imagine your three year old coming into school every day. Your teacher's like, ""Oh he's so tall. He's so cool. I want to be friends with him. Oh my gosh, that's amazing."" And like these teachers are role models that often in a perfect world, everyone would have a parent that helped guide them but that's not the world we reside in. These parents' limitations, shackle kids from really having that positive role model and seeing what they can then become. These teachers can provide a clear roadmap to that. They look up to them and what does that create a world? It creates a world of dreamers. That a future looking down the line, kids who want to do things with their life instead maybe you have a bad role model at home and you see your parents drinking alcohol all the time and just sitting around.

By focusing on adaptation, that means that we are far more focused on massive resettlement, that not only exists because we need to resettle people because of the actual climate change that's happening, but when we actually stop the ability for us to prevent area extractions, that means that local Indigenous communities are firmly being displaced by those extractive practices.

If you didn't, if you weren't able to go to preschool or kindergarten, then you're already behind. You didn't get to start learning math and start learning reading to the same level that other children did when you first get into school. So you're already disadvantaged when you start, you're already behind. And that carries out through your entire education because generally this is a geographical issue. Many of the people with these problems are in the same area and they're going to the same schools. So you have an entire school of kids who are behind because they didn't have these early childhood programs. And so these areas and these demographics of people aren't going to have the same opportunity to get to college as kids from better off areas. So when we fund these sorts of programs, we actually get this solid baseline education for these children. They're able to actually catch up in their education, they're able to have a higher quality of education and it equalizes the entire system, and it gives them a better chance of being able to go to college later on, right? Without this sort of funding for these sorts of programs, you simply don't get that, right? And especially in developing countries who are in so many cases, these programs simply do not exist. It's not like maybe you can't afford to go to them or something, it's they just don't exist. So with this type of funding, not only are you able to subsidize it for people who maybe can't afford it, you're also able to give that money to actually start having these programs in some places that don't have it. And so now kids who maybe people weren't able to send them to preschool or school at all in lots of areas of rural [00:02:56] they don't even have child labor laws, so they just send their kids to go work or work for the family or something like that.

That's why we have programs for kids these ages because that's so important for them and that's why we see it in places that don't have these kinds of programs. They have much more difficulty later in school when they don't have access to the same opportunities.

For some reason, in the developed world, we've gotten into this mentality that like, Oh, if you don't have a college degree, you're worthless, and OO acknowledges this. They say that college is just a signaling mechanism and that's absolutely right. It has a lot of it, for a lot of cases it doesn't have much value. As they said, many people can do any job, right? So the college degree is just a barrier for them anyway. If you put more of the funding onto these early childhood programs, then you're giving less importance to the college education, right? Because you're putting the funding elsewhere, you're signaling that, Hey, this college education isn't as important, right? So now that you get this idea that the college education isn't as important from the signaling that it doesn't need the funding and it's not as important as the actual primary school in early childhood. Then you get to see that the college thing is just a signaling thing and you can get many jobs, and many important jobs, in our society that either don't require a college degree right now and are pivotal to society working just having jobs like being a janitor, or a plumber, or truck drivers or things or a lot of stuff like that. They're necessary for our society. But right now people see those jobs as being lesser and people who do those jobs as being lesser because they think that Oh, you couldn't afford a college education, or Oh, you weren't good enough for a college education. When you lessen the importance of a college education, then that mentality starts to go away. And then we can also get rid of some of the payment disparity because now we recognize that these people are just as pivotal in our society as the people who got a college degree, which doesn't do much, so they're actually able to be paid better because you have that new mentality that it's not only the college degree that makes you worthy as a person.

Eventually, in a lot of cases the child isn't going to meet all of those expectations in some cases. Right.

In one case, once this person found out that their parents had actually been being abusive of them this whole time, they no longer felt like living because they no longer saw that their parents were actually a legitimate source of this self worth and now they had nothing left.

First of all, we think that a lot of children do believe that they're worthy of this, whether that's a part of being special or not, but there's going to be this eventual point where there's other challenges that they have to overcome, like poverty or systematic discrimination that they're not able to overcome just because they've been told that they deserve to overcome these challenges or that they're capable of it. Because in a lot of cases, this is just reality. They are not capable of overcoming those challenges, right?

So you never get this effect, any of these effects that they're talking about. Oh, a child feeling like they're special. Because again, if everyone is the same type of special because everyone's parents are telling them that their child is special, you don't get these effects because if everyone has the same level of specialty, then there's nothing special about it. Right. So you lose all the uniqueness of that speciality and the kid no longer has any reason for that speciality. So one of the biggest impacts of this is, there are some types of children who, we do need to tell them that they're special because they do matter and they are important. Like kids with Asperger's or autism, which can be reframed as super powers. You know, they talk about this, but we get that better on our side because instead of telling everyone they're special, including these children, maybe if we're just telling these children they're special because that's what they need, instead of everyone.

And finally I want to talk about this through an abstract, abstract level and bring up the theory of social contract theory. So just by virtue of being a citizen of the United States, really any country in the entire world, right?

They take more energy to light, cost more money to light, cause more money to heat, and more energy to cool. Basically, to do anything in them just because they are so much larger, they use a lot more energy, which is not great for the environment because they are pulling in more energy from the environment. And as global climate change is such a prevalent problem today, we would like to do things to prevent this from spreading further than it already has. And we believe this task could be a means to punish those who are abusing their money and promoting climate change.

156,"And secondly, moving onto our two main points that kind of go together. There's currently a large socioeconomic stratification in housing. Because in addition to the racial differences of people that are in housing, the locational differences are extremely major too. When you have these large communities of houses, there usually just that. They're communities. They're in super large segregated areas. You have a lot of mansions all in one block versus the less expensive homes owned by poor communities are also all together. You have these really large differences in communities and people who live in these communities. And they're physically separated. We believe by promoting a tax that punishes people for owning wealthier homes, there's going to be less of a desire to buy wealthier homes. And a maybe a desire to sell your larger home and move to smaller one. As I said before, since this tax is punitive, I assume it would actually be effective in promoting the wealthy to downsize their homes.",constructive1,,rdames,round1,rdames_round1,0.0,76.0

Property tax in a certain area, whether you're a high tax or a low tax, that is what is funding public schools. If you have people in an area of wealthier homes together very far away from an area of less wealthy homes together, the people who live by themselves segregated with the wealthy homes, they are going to have a lot more funding for their public schools.",constructive3,,rdames,round1,rdames_round1,0.0,76.0

What I mean is, when you have more people living in houses that are closer together and less completely segregated by wealth, their property taxes are being pooled together, so you have more equally funded schools. Of course, it would not be perfect, but it would definitely be significantly less stratify what you see today. With the extremely wealthy people going to school in some areas and poor people going to horrible public schools, particularly in cities and stuff like that. We believe this would create more opportunity because when the wealth disparity between public schools is lessened, the education quality that these students get is also... the disparity of quality is also lessened. So you have more access to better teachers for poor communities.

That's why dress codes exist in workplaces, offices, uniforms, like clothing stores, why when you're in a professional business setting, you wear professional clothes to portray this image of professionalism and well qualification. That's why when you work in clothing retail stores, you dress fashion week, portraying this to your customers, that you have the authority and ethos to talk about this. So when you wear a religious symbol while you're working for the government, it puts forth the idea that the government supports this image and supports this religion, sports this religious symbol, as in all the ideals that come with this religion.

So, small religions can feel overpowered by larger religions. There's already current discrimination based on other visible aspects such as gender and race, and you don't want to set potential for religious discrimination based on visible symbols. So we'll want to lower any attempt at discrimination from that reason. Religion is based on an outside structure, not elected officials. We don't want outside structures having an impact on our elected officials, such as Catholicism has the Pope. The Pope was not elected by the Catholic people, by people who are Catholic. So you do not want this large structure that the government, that people of America, Mexico, or Canada, did not elect to be so heavily influenced by this outside source.

Obviously not all people who are Catholic are pro life or pro choice, but that thought does run through your mind, that it does say, wait, maybe I can't talk to my doctor about it.

This fear that comes from the associations that have to do with religion is inherently bad for the job, and the government. The federal government has an interest in their civil servants doing the job well because that's the job that they're hired to do.

First on the idea of personal agency, I think it's really important to acknowledge that people renting, or people who are not being able to afford homes, is generally just a bad thing in general. The reason for this is, for example, when you talk about control of your home and how that should matter to you. But also it's things like, for example, not having control of your home or being under a landlord or someone also increases your chances of sickness, poor conditions and, in general, unsafety. And the thing is, under landlords it's very hard to actually fix those situations because of things like, for example, bureaucracy that's been set up through lobbying of local town governments; and it's been set up to make sure that people have the right to be able to address their concern, especially when serious stuff like people getting sick, but also that it's not your home.

These are people who will be buying homes either way and these are people who have higher socioeconomic standing, and who in that case are going to be having that building to get this without having to sacrifice their entire lives. But even past that, I'd also like to acknowledge that this harms marginalized groups, I don't think government properly addresses that. First of all, I just want to mention that there are two types of people who are going to be affected by this resolution. First type of people are people who are going to be able to afford homes either way, and are just going to do so out of more diminishing return or at a rate at which would be a hindrance to the return. These are people who will be buying homes either way and these are people who have higher socioeconomic standing, and who in that case are going to be having that building to get this without having to sacrifice their entire lives.

The amount of people who are actually poorly affected by this on the other hand are people who are in that case, aren't able to afford homes, or barely able to afford homes in the current status quo. People who are barely able to reach their mortgage payments, who are barely able to get these homes under their balance statements that we're getting back, who are struggling to make ends meet. When you increase the taxes, you make it so that these people aren't able to actually get the homes that they need and they aren't able to get all the benefits that Tyler talked to you beforehand. And cutting these people, who are barely able to afford their homes out of economy is what leads towards things like rent that Tyler talked about. There were entire races of people and communities weren't able to afford homes, weren't able to impress in society and gain socio economic standing because of the fact that they weren't able to buy a home, get by that wall and climb the ladder in that sense. Under this resolution you're actually putting people who are in danger of things like renting and stuff like that, more likely to rent because of the fact that they can't afford homes anymore.",constructive2,4.0,rqurbana,round1,rqurbana_round1,0.0,75.0
1399," But one more thing to mention as well is the fact that when the amount of tax that goes on the home goes higher, your chance of not being able to pay that back goes higher as well. Mortgage companies and people who own debt are going to notice that and raise another cost on you because of the fact that you are more than likely to default and not be able to pay back the payment. This makes you even less likely to afford this home in the future, especially if you already have the worst credit score which typically happens much more often in these poor communities, and it'll affect the poor much more throughout the bottom part of that area I was talking before, where you're already struggling to make ends meet, where you're already struggling to afford that home in the first place. Those people won't be able to afford these homes at all.",constructive3,2.0,rqurbana,round1,rqurbana_round1,0.0,75.0
1400,"Moving onto discrimination. Again discrimination help them do the things like redlining, similar policies to what the government is currently proposing. And if you increase the taxes on these things, you increase things like rent, you increase your inability to move between house which make it more expensive to own a house in the first place. And again, the people this hurts the most are people who can barely afford housing in the status quo already. And the fact of the matter is that when you're talking of building stuff like that, you aren't going to be able to change your homes if you are already struggling to pay the taxes on top of your mortgage and everything like that, everything's Also in terms of lobbying for legislation, we already talked about how you're not going to be having rich people moving towards poor neighborhoods and trying to advocate for helping those poor neighborhoods getting so much better. Typically going to still see these racial divides and really see those people living in the communities that lived there before, because the fact of the matter is rich people didn't buy homes in cities. Cities were built around rich people, who used their excessive wealth from owning homes to help the city build the neighborhoods, build the public transportation, through their business, through their taxes afterwards. And that's why they exist there, not because rich people... sorry And essentially if you get them moving towards things like owning rental businesses, or trying to get a stake in stuff like that instead, you are just getting them onside for the people who are currently trying to exploit and gouge away from people who are the most vulnerable in society.

Why do you think that there are a million think tanks, thousands of really smart people paid really highly to consider what reality looks like and thousands of scientists try to determine what the pictures of reality look like?

And the way in which they are interpreted is through personal experience, is through live experience, is through contextualization, because the numbers themselves don't tell you anything. For example, dudes like Trump has a higher employment percentage than Obama and that's something told you by Republicans. There needs to be contextualization around why that number is.

Now that you believe that your view is probably the truth is probably correct that's what, for most people, what trying to be objective actually looks like. You don't realize that your own experiences, that the staff that you see, the facts that you see are still only your subjective view and you are viewing the window through a lens of your experiences still. We prefer a world in which people recognize and accept that all of their experiences, all of their attempts to be objective are still part of only a subjective view of their own lived experiences because you fundamentally cannot get the full picture. You cannot get all the information about what reality looks like and you need to be willing to accept it. See, I think the problem that social movements run into, and this is really where we extend on OGs conception of what movements look like, is that the problem of social movements isn't that they need to just emotionally charge their arguments, but rather that they run into a brick wall of society to believing in its own objective truth. When the suffrage movement fought for woman to actually have votes, the narrative was that the objective truth was, told by society, was that women were too emotional to vote and women should be caregivers, that woman should not have that right. And that was the narrative given by society that was propagated as the truth. That's the one you run into.

First, because there is some possibility of reciprocity. They say Hezbollah can't threaten Israel, because it's not a state. But it has presence in Gaza and it has significant presence in the government in Lebanon. Of course it can threaten Israel. Second, because Israel is politically involved for all the reasons they identified. Third, because there are broad consequences for attacking and hurting Russia. Anyway, that is to say if they are right about this characterization, Israel already knows that there might be some political consequence for killing Russian troops and that Russia might attack them or might not like it if this happens and so some undercurrents probably already exist. Fourth, Israel is only dong these attacks in a buffer zone near the Israeli border in Syria. That is to say, Israel isn't really interested right now in poor the Middle East and trying to export the rebels who oppose Assad. They're interested in destroying the Hezbollah kept operates near the Israeli border and launch missiles and rockets from that area into Israel. So, they're doing these strikes in a limited and careful way near the boarder. Russia was able to defend themselves against that. At this point, I think that Assad can stabilize most of Syria, which isn't that bad for Russia, it's not that bad for trading.

Netanyahu is unpopular because he might be indicted for corruption. The state is putting campaigns on to get more popularity, that's how aggressive and strong he is. Which is like... I think that this idea strengthens the Israeli right. It strengthens the Israeli right, not only because they're perceived as more hawkish, I mean don't rely on the Arabs or [dullish 00:02:40] Zionist parties. But second, because specifically the kingmaker party in Israel right now is Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu. And Yisrael Beiteinu mostly gets its support from Russian speaking Israelis who fled from Russia who don't really like the government in Russia. So then you make a kingmaker party have to support Netanyahu, who's being strong against Russia. So Israeli politics gets more hostile to Russia.

Intergenerational poverty in the first place as well. Right? So, in the first place as well. Right? Because public, early childhood, because we also can test this idea because public early childhood care still exist more or less in some degree in most developed nations.  Right? The reason why we don't see entities, they had a correlative result in people going to college as a result of this, is because a lot of these minorities who were systematically disenfranchised or these situation in the first place don't have the access in which I've already characterized in my rebuttal to capital that allows them to send them to these institutions in the first place. And the people who do go, are people are going to either just go either way and even if they don't go to college, they probably have the capital to find ventures in somewhere else. They don't necessarily have to worry as much about the people who require these things. Okay. So we think that out of this, is that you are denied the ability to have access to these resources, which necessarily leads to employment and structural reform or meaningful structural reform, condemns the people to the state that they are in. We just don't think you get the leavers of institutional change that you get necessarily on our side of the house. Right?

1360,"We think that with regards to the relationship between whether or not having significant funding for post-secondary education as a prerequisite for doing early childcare, we would say, first of all, that we don't scrap post-secondary education funding. We don't think that it's the case, that in this world, now, there are no trade schools. Or if there are trade schools, they are solely private and nobody can afford them. Or that there are no community colleges. We simply have changed the funding priority. We also think that it's the case that employable people sort of fill these gaps in employment that they say don't exist, in order to fulfill the needs of early childhood care because of the lack of post-secondary education. It's precisely why that in order to have these benefits, we need the greater funding, in order to incentivize these people. Rather to flee the country, rather to go somewhere else, but rather to stay because there's a financial incentive to be a early childhood care physician, or psychologist, et cetera, or an educator in an existing country due to the priority given to this by the government in terms of funding. We think that creating this kind of financial incentive means that we solve for harm of lack of employability in these positions, that might be caused by an absence of post-secondary education, but also that post-secondary education at least the absence is mitigated by the fact that we aren't scrapping this entirely, and then just pressing to a sufficient degree that we can make up for in the long run the absence of having tons of early childhood care psychologist such that this becomes a lower cost in the longterm and we are able perhaps to shift priority later or to maintaining this priority but do so even greater effectiveness, creating even less educational inequity in the longterm because of the educational inequities that, as my partner tells us, start very early in childhood and therefore need to be resolved at that time.",constructive2,,srao3,round2,srao3_round2,0.0,75.0
1361,"We also think that with regards to this sort of cycle of not pursuing post-secondary education whatsoever, the only side government actually solves for this In order to break the cycle of not going to college, which, side- off, the student tells us is predicated on this idea, ""if my parents had not gone to college, I may not have gone to college."" We think that it's the case that parents who are overburdened by childcare are unable to create the kind of conditions necessary to allow their own children to go to college, to create an environment for their children to attend school because it's more likely for it to be the case that due to subsidize the childcare costs that they have to incur, that may have forced them to work less, to force, in many countries, mothers to remain in the home rather than to continue working to perhaps make it such that their children have to, rather than pursuing post secondary education, take care of their own parents starting from a much younger age because their own parents were unable to advance their own careers or just save up enough money to allow them to be secure so that their children could pursue their own lives which we get by alleviating the burden of parents when they need to take care of their children at a young age.

1538," So now let's get into that short term, long term analysis. When government stopped funding, these things there are unintended longterm consequences. Let's talk about the damage done to parks and wildlife. When we saw a government shutdown, Washington DC state government stopped working, it stopped paying its workers, it stopped maintaining its parks and we saw longterm damage to landlords of the Washington monument. We saw parts in that area getting absolutely trash and the leaves filling up and trash cans. And what does that do? One, it damages the local wildlife in the area in the short term, but also now the Washington monument is damaged forever because there weren't people there to keep it under watch, to repair it when they could and to ensure that nothing like that happened in the first place. Because when you defund programs like this, you put public assets at risk and you put public land at risk and we say that the loss goes beyond that, right? When you defund these things, even if it's just for a few days, government workers without pay, they kind need money to live. Rent doesn't get delayed because the government isn't paying you, health and medical bills don't get delayed because the government isn't paying you. Defamation of wages for days or possibly months can prevent them from paying for their basic needs or upkeeping bills. And while we do believe that the case of religious freedom is important, and we want these people to have it, we believe that ultimately the most powerful mechanism for doing self isn't going to be what has been proposed on our government side. But ultimately going through courts at not having a ground shaking effect and possibly taking longer, will not hurt the vast majority of people existing within a state.

1557,"So for the first question, who are we talking about here and where are we talking about? So comes and says we're talking about two groups or religious minorities that should be protected by government. And then the second group is other minorities who will lose funding and then scapegoat religious minorities. I think as a whole, my partner did a very good job of uniquely classing at them. He points out that there's no link work for why a different minority i.e. an impoverish, person would instantly blame a religious minorities when obviously hyper conservative governments are the ones to blame. He does great analysis how it's way more reasonable to expect that they will collectively recognize that they're all marginalized groups and are you fighting against the central government, rather than just committing hate crimes on religious minorities. That's something they can play that opening opposition does not link out. But furthermore, they talk about the ideas that it's too dangerous to show religion, so the government should protect it. But I think that's a very patronizing argument. I think the idea is it even if it's more dangerous to wear a burka, or to have the star of David and we just value people's own agency and there's decision to decide what is safe or what is too dangerous for them. That even if we do accept and acknowledge that there is a unique danger for the specific religious minorities, they have a right to determine whether or not they can wear something, even if it raises their harm. But what my partner uniquely brings to you is how the analysis, how, all white people feel justified. I think this is mentioned opening government that my partner takes a better example, explaining about how I'm more likely to feel justified by the government. And he also does better clashing with opening opposition about why religious minorities will not scapegoated, except by the Alt-right, which they already are in the status quo.",constructive1,4.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0
1558,"So about this, the second question is how does government funding cause change? I think that this was a big point of opening government, but I think what my partner does that such unique contribution that places us over opening government, is he uniquely talks about specific examples that was mentioned but actually goes into details. Opening government did a good job mentioning in the 1960s and the civil rights movement but they kind of stopped there. My partner Sam brings you about how this was funding specifically go towards regions where they didn't want to segregate schools and how these parents, regardless of how hyper conservative they were, how did eventually allow their schools to be integrated. And I think that he also mentioned the unique example about how state roads and how federal funding for road budgeting was then used to lower the drinking age. So I think the fact that he takes these examples and uses them better than opening government should be considered for one of the many reasons why he plays above them. But I also think the fact that his examples show more in detail how this generally works clashes directly with opposition and opening opposition when they see that these areas are hyper conservative and don't care and points out how regardless how conservatives are past presidents show they will care.",constructive2,4.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0
1559,"So now for the third and final question, that's what my partner's main extension is and the most important thing that I brought, and that's how federal funding used and how its maintained to protect all minorities. My partner brought unique principle and practical analysis into that. He says that this has true values to a one transactional that just on principle, federal funding is a transactional thing. It's just not an obligation, which is something that opening opposition and just says it is that reality is it's a chip that the federal government's like, ""We give you this if you realistically obey our ideologies and laws"" and they'll state governments are going to be like, ""Yes."" So when the state governments refuse to, even if it does work a small group of people that no longer get some access to welfare things, the government is obligated to take away the transactional chip because the contract's broken. But even more importantly and how we get the fact that the government consistently protects all minorities on a national level and what my partner brings you the idea of value consistency. And the idea is that when the federal government decides what receives federal funding and what doesn't, they decided this is a value that they will, that they believe everyone in their nation should consistently receive that when the government is on a nonnegotiable table on this thing, that it shows a value consistency that shows that normally since the president or other States that they removed funding for this. Then when the government's like ""Religious groups are protected, people of color are protected, like LGBT people are protected."" That it only has value in the consistency and upholding it",constructive3,3.0,tcarrou,round5,tcarrou_round5,0.0,76.0
1585,"So going to my partner's first point about what do kids go through and he mentioned that kids are unique in that they don't have experience at judging difficulty. And the uniqueness leads to an absence of the self esteem. And this is important in that because due to their inexperience and lack of comparison, they have no way to gauge for themselves. So children are special because they strive for validation and ideally want to improve their self esteem and self worth. But they're also uniquely vulnerable because they have small ideas on self worth either if I can well on something to get validation can become very harmful to how they develop confidence. So I think that's the away with the first point. That children are uniquely vulnerable because they need to have a validation system because otherwise they have to strive for an external means of validation.",constructive1,3.0,tcarrou,round6,tcarrou_round6,0.0,75.0

When we see this in the workplace with very real tangible detriments to people, that women feel like they are less able to assert themselves in the workforce. And are often by men. So we think that this is just unique, but when children do get validated and when they no longer have to worry about the external sense of validation, they're more confident as teens, which processes them to being more assertive about getting things they want, i.e. trying for certain clubs, trying for other things, trying for certain positions, doing debate. And then as a result they normally are rewarded with better promises for getting into better colleges, more confident in how they assert themselves in college and a result because it's leads to better results because they're more enabled to speak out for themselves. They're more likely to have better jobs, but even if they're not in the jobs that they would have had anyways, they more likely do know I deserve to be heard.

One, you either own it because you want a vacation home, in which case you only go there during vacations where your friends want to go on vacations, which is maybe one month out of the year or secondarily you own it as a form of a passive investment, in which case you're not going to be going to it at any given point.

What this means is that imposing a tax on secondary homes is going to decrease the incentive to buy a secondary home because the cost is higher, which means homes that otherwise would've been vacant are now going to be owned by people that are living in them as their primary home.",constructive1,,thecactus,round1,thecactus_round1,0.0,76.0
484,"Why is that preferable to decrease the number of vacant homes? Two reasons. First, is that it improves housing prices. That is, when we have less homes that are vacant, that means there are a larger number of homes that are on the market with the same number of people interested in living with them, which has a meaningful impact on the cost of living in these regions. That makes housing more accessible and gets to that right to housing that our opening half talked about.",constructive2,,thecactus,round1,thecactus_round1,0.0,76.0
485,"Secondarily, it has the impact on crime. Vacant homes disproportionately increase crime rates in areas. A couple of reasons. One, vacant homes function as a literal location to conduct crime. Last week there was a drug bust in Ohio that was a vacant home that somebody owned, people have there and started cooking meth. This is one of the most common ways you can start your drug operation or any kind of a criminal organization because they're never checked in on and the police don't go there because they're vacant. Secondarily, they function as targets or vandalism and the vandalism creates an optic effect of crime that encourages other vandals and other criminals to be more active in the area.

Why is it good to encourage them to instead be renting? A couple of reasons. The first reason is that it mitigates housing bubbles. Consumers are vastly irrational when it comes to housing in a couple of ways. For one, opening opposition already tells us that people tend to be unaware of other investment opportunities besides housing. That means if they have money and want to invest, they default to housing even if it's not a wise investment.",constructive3,,thecactus,round1,thecactus_round1,0.0,76.0

488,"Why did affect the housing bubble? A couple of ways. The first is it actually prevents housing crashes in the first place. That is, people are no longer buying homes when they can't afford them because those people on the margin who do not have the capital to be able to afford the home, and would only be buying a few things like securitized loans, are no longer able to go afford it and instead opt to rent homes instead. Secondarily it means that when you have that something that increases prices or decreases jobs, that just some kind of a small recession that would cause people to default on their mortgages, those people that would default on their mortgages, instead just have to move to a lower cost rental home. That is, they never incur the debt and they never cause lenders to default, which is what causes these housing crashes in the first place.",constructive4,,thecactus,round1,thecactus_round1,0.0,76.0
489,"That's why we're not actually getting these kinds of recessions in the first place. This is the single biggest impact in the round. Why is this the biggest impact in the round and not just a niche impact? Once, we tell you the recessions were inevitable and cyclical. They're going to happen, but secondarily we tell you that when they happen, the frequency with which they happen is more common than the length of time that people own a home, i.e. you might own a home for 30 years, but a recession might happen every 10 years. So we can reasonably expect that a recession is going to hit the home that you own and finally when this does happens, this has the potential to completely erase all of your wealth.

Secondarily, we think it's worth noting that Russia is also in a seriously economic downturn. They have lifted massive amounts of money in the last years, a military spending that has not brought in the revenue that they thought it would. Their oil revenue has dropped consistently, especially after sanctioning from Europe over the past five years. We think that Russia's goals in addition to trying to establish its middle Eastern military base in order to be able to airstrikes, it's probably also could you this as an opportunity to expand in economic opportunities by using Syria as leverage for negotiations and OPEC and to better control the oil trading business's substantial number of their exports. For those reasons, we think there also has priority interest that can outlay from of the military interests we're talking about here. First argument is Russian optics. Let's be really clear, despite what we're going to hear from opening government, Hezbollah is globally recognized as a terrorist actor. Even if you believe every single they are going to tell you about how there's faith building is sending him money. Regardless of all of that, they are still recognized as a terrorist organization for optical purposes. What does that mean? So far, Russia has pollinated Hezbollah within Syria. They have not bombed them, but they also have not directly supported them or armed them. The moment that Russia now publicly acknowledges cause recognize have already been implicitly backwards and higher time as a sheer force in Syria. The only switch here is Russia is now officially recognizing that they support Hezbollah, a globally recognized terrorist group. This we think is likely to be the tipping point at which countries around the world have to withdraw their support for Russia both economically and militarily. A few things are likely to happened. One, I think this is the most likely event, it's going from reoccur substantive American and European sanctions against Russia at a time when they can barely afford their existing military expenses.",constructive1,5.0,thecactus,round9,thecactus_round9,0.0,

We care about the Israeli government thinks and the connections that they have to the US government. What does the Israeli government think of the US government right now? It's an instance of which Trump is viewed as the most heavily American influenced leader, buy the US Israel lobby in the last 20 years. It's a government in which Trump's voter base, a dominantly religious voter base in the United States, has explicitly prioritized Israel over Russia in past polling instances. We think this is unlikely to be sufficient despite factors to think that the US won't intervene. Secondarily, even if you don't think that the US will intervene, we still think that the Israeli defense force is more than enough of a deterrent factor. These forces is one of the most advanced military in the world. The iron dome alone composing of ground to air missile systems knocked down almost any potential Russian plane in the area would knock down more casualties technologically than Russia saw through the entire intervention in Syria. Not to mention all the other kinds of advanced technologies implemented by Mossad from robot killer flies that can peck you on the neck and kill you. Russia does not have the technology to be able to compete and we don't think they're going to be sending in ground troops, but it's going to be sending the helicopters to get shot down. Secondarily, we think that they're likely to be able to call Russia's bluff. That is what Russia has an incentive to try to deter Israel the moment that Israel decided they want to invade, Russia has no incentive to respond. That is that they don't actually have any incentive other than the signaling to start a very, very costly war with Israel.

The Zionist lobby in Israel views this as a religious war and views Hezbollah and the Iranian army as a threat on the religious views of its people. In Israel's history religious independence has always taken precedence over geopolitical gates.

We think that it's important for these governments to just make kind of a peg currency so that other governments cannot exploit them on the international stage. If ASEAN can collaborate to prevent the United States or China from exploiting them, we are fully supportive of that kind of situation.

So, even if you have to join a kind of conglomerated collectivized union, as these countries have already consented to join, we think that this means that they're able to have a better kind of status of life for all of the citizens in that country. So, what is the most important thing to weigh in this debate, is how do we get individual actors and individual people in each of these countries to get the most benefit out of the situation?

1294,"First off, my contention number on is that objectivity is necessary to the political process. In the United States, for example, or just Western liberal democracy in general, which I believe that we agree is kind of the scope of the debate, we can see that when we're making policy that applies to the macro level, we absolutely need to know the wide scale objective changes that are going to occur as a result of our policy. One person's experience in relation to this policy should not be something that outweighs the objective statistical values that are achieved through this policy. For example, one of the things that we're doing right now is... An argument is common in America these days, to basically say that, ""Well, there are problems with this policy because it's going to make life harder for a select few individuals."" But they seem to ignore on the other side of that policy is that it's making it easier for millions of Americans to live in a different way. I don't have a policy to specifically list off the top of my head, but this kind of emotional manipulation is used in politics. Pathos is absolutely abused across the media where they're talking about conservatives, republicans, or socialists and democrats. We can see that the pathos of an argument is abused rather than simply taking the objectivity of the options here.",constructive1,,wylywalker,round3,wylywalker_round3,0.0,73.0

One of the things that we can see again in Western liberal democracy, is oftentimes we can, as the governments of Western liberal democracy, that bad decisions are made when emotions are high. We can see this time and time again throughout history. One of the examples that I'd like to bring up is countries in Europe accepting too many refugees. Now, I don't want to say that we should be accepting refugees in. It's simply that they look at a situation and they say, ""We want to help out."" Then when emotions are high, they make the decision to open their border completely. An example of this is in Germany. There are certain districts of the country that there is massive cultural clash because the Western liberal mindset of most of the people that live in Germany is clashing with a foreign culture that they're not experienced with. This isn't to say that either culture is bad. It's simply saying that the cultures are less compatible than what is ideal. It ends up becoming a massive problem because there's lot of cultural clash. Even someone like Angela Merkel, who was for the Open Borders Policy, says that she regrets making the Open Borders Policy.

1613,"essentially comes down to believing, simply, that you are purposeless in this universe, that there's nothing, specifically, unique about you. Nothing has really any meaning. And then, what do I mean when I talk about religion and when I say religion, I mean broadly religion. The belief there is a creation structure, there's a beginning, middle and end of the universe and there is, generally, purpose in the world. That's why I'm moving into my contention number one, which is talking about religion versus nihilism and a broader topic to really engage on. So, Number one, when we look at nihilism, nihilism throughout its existence as a philosophy and as a general worldview has bred a sense of purposelessness. Now, how does my nihilism connect and the sense of purposeless connect to the belief or the teaching that children are, essentially, not inherently special or different from others? Well, essentially what you see is if you teach children that they are not special or different from others, then there's going to be a central nihilism to their self understanding. If I don't believe that I am different from my partner Caleb here, then why am I going to be trying to make my own individual contributions? Why am I going to try to change my lot in life, beyond what he's ready to do? Now, I'm not saying that this belief is a right way of understanding the nihilistic philosophy, but I'm saying that this, essentially, does happen to large numbers of people when they do believe in nihilism. We can see this in nihilistic communities across the country where there is a lack of religion. It's a lack of purposefulness and a lack of a belief that you are an inherently special being within the universe, who has an ability to make special contributions to the world, one is less able to evade mental illness and suicidality. So, you can see in religious communities across the country, there is far lower rates of suicidality and mental illness. If we look at the Muslim community, Buddhist community around the world, if you look at the Christian community, we can see that there's much less suicidality and mental illness within these communities than there are in communities that described themselves to be atheist or without religion.",constructive1,3.0,wylywalker,round6,wylywalker_round6,0.0,74.0
1614,"But, I want to go ahead and talk about my final clarifying argument under my first contention and that is its overall healthier for children to believe that they are inherently special. Growing up as a child, I don't believe that I would have come to be interested in the things that I'm interested in and pursue the things that I'm passionate about, if I never believed that I was an inherently special person within this world. I, personally, am religious and I think that's one of the greatest strengths that I have, going into my adulthood is because I see that I have a track in life that I want to pursue. 
I want to follow and I believe I can make special contributions to the world. If I didn't believe that I could make special contributions to the world, I was not myself inherently special, I would have much less passion towards going what I want to go into, but I want to go ahead and move down with my remaining time to talk about my second implication or my second contention, which is talking about the broader implications. Again, when we're looking at talking about the belief of inherent speciality for children, we can see that it's much more difficult for children to believe in their own individualism and their ability to contribute as a society. If they are not taught they're inherently special, this leads to a lack of individuality and we can see that societies throughout history that have an emphasis on individuality, the United States and most Western liberal democracy as being an example. Individuality leads to innovation and progress that has been, heretofore, unseen in world history. We can see strides in equality and progress and environmental concern. A bunch of different factors are impacted by society's belief in individuality and reliance on individuality as a whole. This isn't to say that communities don't matter. This is to say that individuality is incredibly important and that's why we, as the government team, believe that we must teach our children that they are inherently special.",constructive1,3.0,wylywalker,round6,wylywalker_round6,0.0,74.0

Remortgaging increases equality through the following mechanism. You can remortgage your house through what you invest in it to invest or simply to get you out of tricky situations. For example, if you're caught up in court, what you can do is remortgage your house to help pay for very expensive law bills, which also disproportionately affect the middle class.

So the mechanism is as follows. If feelings or subjective experiences are acquired, then you gather more rich and thick descriptions of a phenomenon that consequently better inform you to make policy. There are a variety of different problems and solutions that were derived in the world and that have come out of political debates that simply could not be informed by objective fact. If anything, truth with a capital T and objective fact is not something that applies to solving some of the greatest challenges in the world. A very good example of this is a study that was conducted and had qualitative methods that were used, focused on subjective feelings, about what the impact for Asian American immigrants was coming to United States. And what they ultimately to the policy, and the point of the political debate that came out of this was, okay, what is it that they experienced when coming here and how can we better inform our policy in our politics? And you cannot answer that question by looking at objective fact. That is way too narrow and reductionist. So instead, what was done and which effectively proves the argument that we're trying to make today is, instead what happened was interviews were conducted, shared experiences were shared, and from that, a whole rich, thick set of data came out, and consequently informed in how to better, in an informing way, of us understanding the true impact of, for example, segregation and assimilation on Asian American immigrants. Now this is a very broad example and to connect it back to the resolution, I want to talk about its impact. So the impact of this greater idea of subjective experiences and feelings provide a whole more holistic understanding of policy, and therefore are important in a debate and that's why we regret it. The impact can be seen simply, for one, by looking at the comparative. So if these feelings and subjective feelings were excluded from this debate, then we simply would not have insight into feelings of, specifically in this case and which can be seen on a more broad scale, marginalized communities.",constructive1,,zoejohnson,round3,zoejohnson_round3,0.0,75.0
1581,"So, first of all, we would like to assert that one, teaching your children that they are special, and this is through an ingrained set of constant reminding, because that is what teaching is as opposed to telling, and we must recognize that. So, teaching your children that they are inherently special is unbelievably and intrinsically linked to a Western capitalist system of thought, and system of governments. It is a way that a culture simply exists. And there are a lot of flaws in approaching it in this way. And on the closing opposition, we will vehemently argue in favor of a collectivist's perspective to better serve society over that of an individual. ",constructive1,3.0,zoejohnson,round6,zoejohnson_round6,0.0,73.0
1582,"Now, moving on to my reframing, and why a collectivist approach to a society is better than that of an individualist, and why an individualist approach is intrinsically linked to telling your children that they are special. The mechanism is as follows. If you tell your child, ""You are special,"" you are inherently telling them, ""You are unique."" And this was pointed out quite eloquently by the closing government. You are telling them, ""You're a unique individual."" And what that translates to, in turn, is them internalizing this feeling of them as an individual and applying it to their life. So, for a short list, ""I'm an individual, I am special, I am unique. Therefore, I deserve to advance my stocks in this way. I deserve to live in this community over this community. I deserve to put myself first, my family first over this community, these people, these minorities, all of the above."" And at the base level, this can be intrinsically tied to a Western individualist society, and therefore, capitalism. So for example, capitalism, we see it as based off of the individual. You can simply not refute that. An individual's own ability. And also, an individual's ability to improve things for themselves to the benefit of themselves. So, we argue instead, that ... So, clearly there is a very clear link as to how these two things manifest. And it can also be seen in the fact that if you go to a more collectivist country in the East, you go to Japan for example, you are not going to see many parents in a traditional collectivist society telling their children, ""You're special. You are unique, and you are this individual."" So basically, on that argument alone, I find that this helps believing that parents should be telling their children that they are special simply doesn't stand within a world context, which is, broadly speaking, what the government defined, and therefore, it falls. Because if you try and implement this, opposition believes, ""No, this should not work because one, you're in favor of a collectivist society, but also this could not be implemented within a collectivist society for cultural barriers that already exist and serve their own ends.""",constructive1,3.0,zoejohnson,round6,zoejohnson_round6,0.0,73.0
1583,"So, to elaborate on this, and to elaborate why not telling, to solidify that mechanism, why not telling your kids are special or unique, serves a greater social purpose and an end. And we're going to look, to support this, at a case study case example, if you will. So again, we're looking at East collectivist cultures that rely on other principles to raise their children. So for example, some qualities of the collectivist culture include the feeling of shame. And that is something that you learn from that concludes the idea of mistakes that the opening opposition touched upon. But it is also in a collectivist culture, where everything is so intertwined, it is a feeling of connection and duty of service to your community. And that feeling of service to your community, to your elders, and respecting the people around you, is fundamentally based in the understanding that you are not special, that you are not unique, and that you do not serve as an individual person within their own individual capacity. And I suspect that the closing government will try and say, ""Well, you know what? How does this promote innovation?"" And here, we say that there is innovation in Japan. And all of what opening and closing government fail to distinguish is how without saying special, they fail to effectively state why being told special is the key driver of innovation. And again, just to go over and solidify that linked about this individual collectivist kind of reframing of the argument, we argue strongly because this house is really determining, and the purpose of this discussion and this debate is to determine, ""What is the best thing that we do?"" 
And again, we see time and time again within collectivist cultures, a clearer and more strong feeling of community. And what does that translate to? What is the impact? A great social safety net, a greater feeling of community, less in-group and out-group discrimination. And on that basis, we normally reframe this argument, but demonstrate how the government has really failed to meet the burden.

But secondly is the financing all things within using that currency, whether it's debt that they need to be using that currency for or whether it's going to be hurting international trade. All those reasons are why they care. The members of ACIAR grow to care about each other when they're tied together with a currency like the comparative is that China is much easier able to pick off countries like Vietnam, Cambodia because they put their individual interests over that of Southeast Asia. We tip that balance towards Southeast Asia rather than individual interests when they're having to go China because of the fact that they care about, they care more about the success in Southeast Asia. Another way in which we place a third way in which we increased the ties between Southeast Asian nations is that when you decrease the transactions costs of trade and we'll need to have more trade presents within ACIAR itself, that means you've increased the regional ties between each other.

Now where this becomes very important is a contemporary example such as that of trans people, who have experiences that can only be viewed through a subjective framework. Our modern understanding of gender cannot be physically observed. You can't find the gender in a microscope as far as we know yet. But for our current understanding, the only way to understand the issue properly is to listen to people. It is to take in these subjective experiences and give a modicum of trust towards it. And so once again, bringing the elephant in the room, Ben Shapiro, one of the issues is that people will discuss ... often it was appealed to the idea that ""Oh, trans people are just against basic biology,"" and so of course this is something that can be unpacked and debated further. However, for a significant basis of the population, just having that sort of idea of, ""Oh, it's just basic biology,"" is enough to cloak themselves in a very objective framework of feeling like they have reached the objective facts, but because they have not listened to the lived experiences and been able to get a more nuanced fleshed out view of the world it leads to systemic biases being reinforced, because many of these biases come from pre-existing power structures, things that have been implanted in people from childhood. And so because there is nothing that can be done to really take those biases out without proper exposure to new ideas or proper exposure to new subjective experiences, this idea of just staying objective, just ignoring feelings is a way to reinforce those power structures very easily.",constructive1,4.0,adamursenbach,round3,adamursenbach_round3,1.0,77.0

Where we systemically value subjective experiences, then political debates can be more diverse. They can be more truthful. They can be more real when we understand that everybody has subjective experiences that contribute to the truth. When we see one category of people as objective, when we see one category of one people who bring facts as objective, then we're harming the other people in the debate, who can tell other people that they are being subjective and thus less valued in the debate. That we can tell them that they're wrong because we are objective, when we are not. So next op tells you that objective truth is more important. In our world, objectivity is not what's valued in debate. In our world, subjectivity is valued in debate. And thus, we create a better world where everyone's experiences have the opportunity to be valued and cannot be masked under false objectivity. We see a world where subjectivity is actually valued and is not seen as something less than. We see emotional personal experiences of groups of people that are not seen as less than.

The way we get more diversity in debates is because people who have the privilege to be objective, no longer have the only card to play in the debate. They can't undervalue people in the debate because they're being subjective, because they're affected by an experience. The subjective experience is therefore valued, and they can't just discount them because they're not being objective.

When the people who are telling them that they aren't objective have the power to be objective, because they're not actually affected by the outcome of the debates. Therefore, this is really problematical. When we see objectivity is not real, we see subjectivity is valued. Then we get a world where multiple opinions can exist at the same time and therefore we get better debates, we get better politics and then we get better emotions, better social good overall.

So it means that any business which has risk diverse, but just thinking about global conditions, is massively more likely to invest in or do trade with another country because they know that there's no macroeconomic effects that they can't predict that's going to literally send their profits to zero. But additionally, externally, we think that because you have a lot of different countries which often have slightly different structure of their economy, you're less likely to see all of them collapse at once. So we think that the growth in these countries is likely to be less volatile, and as a result the currency is likely to be less volatile. That is to say, when people buy currencies because they believe they can make some kind of return off of them. So if you think that growth is more stable, you're more likely to buy that currency, you're less likely to This matter is a turn because we think that sustainable investment is often a clear opposite to economic development. So there's lots of investment in places like Thailand for example, before the 1998 financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis, but eventually all that money was pulled out because the hot money turned cold. People were worried that the currency was going to devalue and it led to a self-reinforcing cycle where people pulled more and more out of the money out of the country. They cut their growth slow, the currency devalued further and as a result, almost all of the benefits of this investment disappeared. That is to say even if you had a company go up and build a factory, like there was a massive recession, like the infrastructure couldn't be used later, it wasn't actually helpful.

1272,"So second, I want to talk about how you can get more stable monetary policy. That is to say, if you only have one country, especially since a lot of these countries don't have particularly stable forms of democratic governance, with one centralized figure in charge, you're likely to see monetary policy for the short-term political incentives of equal opportunity in the country at the time. This means that, if there's a recession, they may drop interest rates as low as they think is feasible. And I'm not sure that politics is going to be right about this. And as a result, they are going to devalue their currency. It's going to be terrible. It's going to be instabilized even the said investors are less likely to invest in means that... It's just awful. Right? And we think that if you have a lot of different countries fighting over the best kind of economic policy, first you're going to get more discussion about what is actually appropriate, what is actually good for the block. And second, it's less likely to be as volatile you're more likely to see this happen. So what is the impact of this? The impact is first, I think this is a prerequisite to economic development. If the currency is not stable, you will not get sustainable investment. And these countries have a comparative advantage, and then they have cheap labor. But you need capital to be able to develop the economy to do things like building infrastructure to provide access to things like electricity in outline world regions. So, the only way you get that is with a more stable currency with investments from other actors. And certainly we think this also promotes long term political stability. That is to say, if there's more jobs for people, we think there's less political discontent. You're likely see the things like inflammation of the middle class and as a result, I don't know, it's just better",constructive2,,amspector100,round4,amspector100_round4,1.0,80.0
1273,"The second argument is about better economic and political integration. A couple of arguments on this.

That means that when China says, ""Hey Cambodia, we would like to do X, we would like to go on this particular Cambodia doesn't have to take the deal. Right? Cambodia isn't as... The ratio of power between Cambodia and China is still skewed to China side, but it gets better. So this means Cambodia can do things like incrementally advocate for better working conditions for people. It means it can incrementally advocate for slightly lower tariffs on its products so it can export things to China too. This is critical because, we think that these countries, especially if they're discussing to start a block, are smart enough not to dilute their comparative advantage, but at the same time ensure that there are basic guarantees of safety to things like their workers, like human rights and working conditions that are not available in these countries right now.",constructive3,,amspector100,round4,amspector100_round4,1.0,80.0

It's because we often think that religious political power is concentrated geographically. So, for example, church organizations, which are often quite political are concentrated in particular areas in the south, which means that if you have the states determinate, like not the federal state. If you have the local state with the provinces determining what religious liberty means, it is more likely to be dominated by religious groups more dominant in that particular state.",constructive2,,amspector100,round5,amspector100_round5,1.0,77.0

But, suppose we're wrong, and suppose taxes We think that that might actually be a good thing for the rest of the country because if tax is eventually likely to come back, their economy's going to collapse.

1627,"international sphere, and as a result people will be nicer to us."" So when the thing that the Israeli people see right now, when they are forming a government, when there's a literal one boot difference or one siege difference between Netanyahu and Gantz, is Russia promising to attack Israel. That's going to make them want someone who has military experience, who's a military leader, who has been leading the country through turmoil for 14 years, someone like Netanyahu who's able to toe the line between protecting Israel without incurring Russian aggression. And you think OG might be right, like I don't really know, maybe Israel will not do these particular attacks against Syria because they don't want to take the risk with Russia.
We think however that they're just going to do things like overt attacks. What does this look like? It looks like funding groups inside Syria who combat Iranian and Russian influence, it looks like cyber attacks and things that you can trace easily back to Israel. We think that this is particularly important and unlikely to trigger a response because, A: Russia literally will not know that Israel cause the attacks because Israel has one of the best intelligence forces in the entire world. Additionally, it will not meet the threshold of the threat because Israel is not actually striking at Syria, Israel is literally funding another group to strike on Syria. And third, political sentiments in Russia prevents them from getting involved in a messy war, especially when their economy is doing pretty badly as it is right now, Without a clear act of aggression. I'll take you there. So why do we think this is worse for control over Syria? Why do we think this is worse for Russian interests? We think because, first, Israel has less control over these groups, so instead of just attacking military installations, there's likely to be more civilian casualties and ferment more unrest, and more dissatisfaction with the government, which cannot actually protect people. But does that mean because Israel can't be blamed for these attacks there's less incentive to keep these attacks clean because Israel is not the one who is punished for them? It is more likely that these attacks are likely to be bigger, messier, and more harmful to Russian influence.",constructive1,4.0,amspector100,round9,amspector100_round9,1.0,
1628,"This matters way more than Iranian oil. By the way, Russia is a net oil exporter. They do not buy oil from Iran. So the reason this matters more is a couple of reasons. First, because you need Chinese technology to build up your military and to build up your military strength. So if you believe that you want access to controlling countries like Syria in the future, or that you just want strong allies like OG the goals of CG and OG, you need a strong military, you need to be able to fund things. And we think that the US right now and China are the only ones who can manufacture semiconductors, which you need to build computers. So, right? If you do not have good access to Chinese technology, if you don't have access to Chinese military technology, you literally cannot build up your military. But second, we also think that China is the main buyer of Russian oil. They export $400 billion in oil and natural gas to China. We think that what the Chinese Russian relationship is not going to last, but it's probably going to get weaker because China does need to signal to the West that they are not on board with this policy, this is not what they were trying to do. We think that even if this number goes down to like $300 billion, this is what you massively tank the Russian economy. We think that this means that you have less ability to fund groups like Syria and actually make sure that Syria has control over its territory. Like CG tells you in the longterm, and this is not, does not just affect one country, but it affects every geopolitical interest Russia has.

That's to say early childhood care may be scarce or expensive for these people, but universities are also very exorbitantly expensive. But importantly, notice also here that there are plenty of nonfinancial barriers to universities, to accessing universities. Things like the neighborhood in which you live in.

These are the most important impacts for developing countries specifically, who want to have a healthy population and an economy that develops, right?

It simply masks it at the point in which what is quantified as legislator is just not allowed anymore, it's just prohibited. We think that there are three main harms that you should care about. Firstly, it is worse for the religious population within that province or state because they now become a target of resentment within that province or state.

That means that many of the actual individuals who were the ones who were on the ground, and are committing the crimes, don't get to go to jail or get to see justice enacted against them. Why is this bad? This means that because there is no clear distinction of what is considered a perpetrator and what isn't, many individuals who may have acted on their own volition, instead of actually being forced into a system where they're doing it, are never prosecuted and they're never held up to justice. Additionally, we have to talk about the fact that these international courts are acting according to Western evidential standards. If we look at the examples of the Rwandan genocide or the Yugoslavian civil war, it took up to 20 years for all this evidence to be collected. Because while these Western individuals were going in, many of the perpetrators were actively destroying. Which means that a lot of these facts that were needed for these trials were never done out, which means that justice was never brought on the individuals. Why does this matter?

If we have a shortage in a specific industry or a sector that essentially mean that sector will not be able to produce innovation, which is the internal link to economic growth in the long term.",constructive3,,arjunp,round2,arjunp_round2,1.0,77.0

So if we don't invest in these trade schools, and if by the government's model, we actually divert money away from these vocational schools, which by the way, they even concede in their previous speech that vocational schools are good. If we divert money from vocational schools, that means these shortages will only get worse and there'll be economic gaps that hurt the longterm stability of western liberal democracies.

If we don't actually fund these schools and give students opportunity to have scholarships and financial aid, which is where a lot of this public funding is going to, these students will not be able to go to these trade schools, go to these specific schools and learn a skill that can bring them out of poverty. This is very important because poverty and that structural bounds are the lowest class of society and if we don't have an education as a tool for them to get out of the structural bounds they will face many problems that will never be resolved",constructive3,,arjunp,round2,arjunp_round2,1.0,77.0

When you fund for educational funding, it's a preventative mechanism. When you fund it like secondary education it's like reactionary or like corrective measures.

Because employers know about this thing that they're going to know that there's this extensive burden as opposed to the one that they have to engage with. This means that the women who have children will more likely to call out a work and not commit because their child gets sick.

It's basically that when people are able to utilize their feelings and their subjective things in political debates. They're able to like shift the narrative how we talk about things. We think that nationalism and populism literally focused on being able to identify with someone's story. When Donald Trump gets up and talks to you about how the white people are being oppressed because people are coming from Mexico and taking their jobs, people identify with that. Although the facts don't really agree with that. The facts don't really say that. We see a large influx of people taking white people's jobs. Instead, politicians are able to manipulate these narratives that they craft in society and scare people and make them want to engage with them politically. This leads to two things. We think that when you focus on facts, both sides are going to benefit, but they're not going to benefit for society. The left is going to polarize its voters to be afraid of nationalists, they're going to be afraid of people who want to cut your social security, afraid of these things. When the facts may not agree with that. But also on the right, they craft these narratives that are going to lead you to hate the other side. Both sides want you to hate each other so you fear the other side. What happens when we vote out of fear and not out of objective truth? I think that what happens is it opens the door for a lot more oppressive policy. This is why Donald Trump is able to pass a law to do a lot of terrible things through executive orders and might have had a he had a Congress and power. Because he was able to write up these mandates that he gets through having a like a voting base that is scared because he manipulates how he engages. He focuses his debating sheerly on personal feelings that have no objective truth to them.

This is especially bad when you have, let's say, Bernie Sanders, who has a black woman who is talking about how a certain policy affects her versus Trump, who gets a white family to talk about the exact opposite experience. Because people are biased, because people are racist, you're probably going to have people go with a narrative that is more palatable to them. So we have how it is substantially harder to inflate an individual experience, especially if it is alive, especially if it isn't on the same level as other people. Whereas, on our side, we have these rejected facts that are really important. What does opposing government try to say to us in response to a lot of this? They talk about how people are never going to be persuaded by numbers, and therefore, it's more important that we have these narratives, which have never really engaged with the mechanisms of why they're specifically harmful.",constructive2,,delaneyh,round3,delaneyh_round3,1.0,78.0

We're saying to not weaponize these narratives that cannot be disproven, and very often cause people to become more polarized in their own respective camps, which completely wipes out any good impacts of people joining political discourse, if a political discourse is terrible. Next, we say that people rarely listen to stories that they don't agree with in the first place. We talked about how they don't listen to these statistics. It's even worse with narrate. People will personally attack the survivors of the Parkland shooting, just because it doesn't agree with their conception of gun control. People will attack Greta Thunberg because she's talking about her own experience over Sweden, and people say she's too far removed to actually be relevant to this debate. So because people naturally have an aversion to stories that they don't agree with, because people naturally have a tendency to bully from the time that they're in middle school, people they don't agree with, it feels way easier to just dismiss the other side on the basis that their story isn't quite palatable to you. That they maybe were paid off protesters or demonstrators from the CIA, in the case of a lot of school shootings, the narrative that comes from the alt-right.

This looks like two things. In more vulnerable communities, the attention that they give to the children, is implicitly connected to their safety, because a parent needs to be very attentive to the child. That child needs to be safe, because a child cannot be at home alone in a neighborhood that is dangerous because the parents don't have the financial stability to move them into a safer neighborhood. Because a daycare is very effective and because of that, access to a school that is safe with getting communities...

People have the incentive to set those prices higher because people are still willing to buy their insurance from this competitive market through the tax that government has placed.

Why is this? If you're renting a place, one, if you're renting your living room, all of a sudden, boom, that double the housing density because you have more people living in the same footprint increase housing density. Would also say that when you invest in a place with the intention of renting, you have more places in a smaller space so that you could have one set of utilities for the entire place you're renting.

Whereas in an urban area with millions of people, it's easy to replace someone if they move out. So it's a lot less risky for you as an investor. Why is this density necessarily a good thing? Three reasons, firstly, we said it's good for the environment because utilities are substantially less needed. You pay for heating to heat a space. So if more people in the same space and per person, less utility.

We say that there are societal benefits because when you're renting to people and you're literally your own house, you're a lot more likely to be mixed with different social classes. When you're riding public transit, you might be likely to see people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. You care about their issues because they're literally your neighbors and to reduce instrumentation on the basis of rich people that own their houses are now more likely to rent them to people that are probably poor off.

So it sort of ties people down to a specific spot.

Likewise, we say that, like if you have certain ideas of what your child is supposed to do in your head, it's very easy to write feedback your child, it encourages them to follow that path, right? I'm not saying that they're necessarily doing this on purpose, but implicitly because they have certain ideas when they think their child should be. Often the times they've had this conversation, push them towards the dentist, right? They didn't project them all. They have to base them on biases that are already had, I think that is needed to a specific subset of walls, right? But even in the best case scenario, where they're just looking at what their kids are actually interested in, they're perfect ideal people when most parents are not, right? These are the facts that children can change, means something might encourage them a set of goals instead of your specialists are the thing to be, like they are five years old, and they might go on with life when they're 18, right? Like I think that just because of these factors, the types of things that you're emphasizing valuing your child are not always good. Why is this bad, right? I see them when you tell your kid you're special, you tie it like I would come to the house or your relationship with them. Great. When you tell your kid you're special, you're doing a lot more than making an objective factor what you're talking to them, right? You're also telling them implicitly like ""You're special, and that's one of the reasons I love you."", Right? Like your trying, the reason you value them to their specialist, right?

So when you constantly praise them for doing like getting good grades, or like being how do you use successful outcomes like succeeding a competition or something like that. I am, the problem there is that they tie their self-worth not just of themselves but also in your eyes to that achievement. Why is this bad, right? I think that when you sort of like praise a specific achievement that you want your child to have, you say ""You are perfect for this role and I'm so glad that like I have you in my life, it's like how good you are at this specific thing and that's the type of relationship with Kevin, your child."" Any case in which they want to stray away from that goal. So when they added all that, there was parents that described that role where they have in society, they don't want to fulfill that role for whatever reason. Maybe that role is misogynistic, maybe they're not interested in anymore or maybe they're incapable of succeeding in that goal. The reason why it is so especially harmful, is because now that all that outcome, that specific thing that you've created, is tied to the relationship I have with you, and also because you're instilling these ideas on them at such a young age, to their own self-worth. Which means that when you constantly praise your child for their achievement, I mean you're like, there's this facet because you're afraid and this is special because this art that you did that I'm so proud of, or is this special that you won the baseball game, right? Then they tie their value to those instruments. Intrinsic neutrons, when they don't succeed, they don't love themselves, am I right?

When we say that when you pray what guy's achievement and what you're specifically capable of as opposed to praising people for trying hard and like even if they're not necessarily capable of the best? We think that we promote a growth mindset where it's more about trying your hardest than it is about being specifically capable of things that is the same. Your bullshit on me to be the best sports person will comparatively better than other people, right? If you compare it to better than your previous self, right? We think it's much healthier and much more scientifically proven to be better at getting better at anything. When you focus on a growth mindset where it's not about what you're objectively capable of, but rather what you can capable of us, sorry, rather than how can we get better at seeing growth, right?

I think the reason why telling your kids really prevents this from happening, is that it focuses on outcomes as opposed to actual like processes. Okay. I think in terms of extreme certification, I would say that what like although we think it's important to like praise children, you don't need to use a metric that is necessarily comparative to other people that were to do this. We don't necessarily just say you're better than other people in some way. I think you're special, which is what that implies, rather than we can just say ""In fact, why don't you try hard intrinsically good in and of itself. You don't have an obligation to be better in order to be happy, in order to feel good about yourself as a person, or whether you love your parents."" I think that's a much healthier relationship you have. That was probably the most important thing for you as a parent. For that reason. I'm proud to oppose.

If you have some sort of life crisis or you are unable to pay your rent in their world, you get thrown out on the street. That's what renters markets look like, right?

And the ability for a child to perform in that system. What this incentive means is that when a child starts doing better early because they are better incentivized by the government, it leads to better scores and better results when they go into different public institutions later on in life.

What that means is, A, you have time, money, resources that you could have otherwise been funneling into daycare, you would've had to do. What that also means is A, you're likely to be a more attentive, better parent when you just have more time to spend with your kids.

So when that happens, it creates a perpetual A, debt that can kind of incur itself on aggregate over time if you're not able to meet these financial requirements having children.

604,"All right. So what does live brought to you specifically? Because I think when we talk about how you actually mobilize for change, the nuance that we give you is what wins us this round here. Because while we have collectivity for people whose minds we need to change to accomplish objective ideas, the people who we actually have to have often to our systems to do the things that we want to do are the people who don't empathize with those people. Right? Because recognize that everybody is individual, everybody has different lived experiences. You can have similar ones, but the people who have similar ones will collectivize anywhere on their side of the house, right. What we actually want are the people who do not share those lived experiences to understand what we have and in terms of our issues, not right now. So how do you do that, right? We say that when you have subjective viewpoints, the people whose mind you're trying to change and the people through which change is actually attempted to be accomplished, are less likely to buy into it when you don't have statistic evidence to show for it. Right? So we tell you that when people in these positions are far more likely to mobilize behind statistic because they don't necessarily have the means to which to empathize with these subjective issues because they haven't lived them.

Because when you have populism, facts act as a specific counterbalance to populous narratives, right? You can have feelings or subjective viewpoints about an issue, but you cannot like de turf that in those scenarios. So when you have a predominant viewpoint that is catered towards facts, it means that you have less populism on our side of the house because it's harder to disprove those notions. Right. And then also what I want to talk about is like specifically why like accountability of politicians is important. Because the way in which incentive structures work for voters means three things. A, you won't be able to appeal to everyone based on emotion and if anything you get worse incentive if you appeal to a minority group based on emotion, because your majority voter base is going to be mad at you because they don't agree with those viewpoints, right? So B, what it means is that you can justify your actions with objective truth that it's far harder to disagree with. So your voter base isn't going to turn on you if you do something to help a minority group. C, what it also means is that politician now have to justify their decisions because this is the ideal and the standard that we set themselves toward.

It's necessary to have this stable source of housing in order to seek employment, in order to be invested in your community. When you're renting, you're always subject to eviction notices from the landlords who are always pickled, who are always going to be increasing the rent as market rates change.

1643,"First on Israel's interest in Syria. Recognizing Israel's longterm interest in Syria is not merely the removal of Iranian influence. It is the longterm destabilization and weakness of the Syrian state. Iranian influence is merely a Trojan horse for that because Iran and Russia are significant factors of Assad. Why is this the case? Firstly Israel on face prefers weaker Arab neighbors because it means they pose less of a military threat. They can provide less support for groups like Hamas or the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Is why Israel has resorted to direct force to it's Arab neighbors before when they invaded Lebanon for 25 years. Secondly, Israel wants a buffer zone in the Golan Heights. It's a territory they've had for a long time and they want to expand it to some extent. Note this is much more possible with a destabilized Syrian state than one which is unified and powerful. Thirdly, the presence of destabilization on Israel's frontiers is what feeds the permanent militarization of Israeli society. Something that is inherently within its interests. It's by the way all those alternatives, sending ships full of money to Iran, won't work because it's not just about helping your ally. It's about ensuring that any force that tries to create structural destabilization within your allies has to be countered. So why exactly do all the things I talked about of Israeli interests necessarily counter Russian interest. Not withstanding the fact that Russia wants allies, which is kind of obvious, but note that there are things directly within Syria on the ground that Russia has a significant stake in. Firstly overseas military presences that aren't just about counting up the number of bases you have and saying we have 150 we're now a mid-sized power now. It's the fact that Syrian has provided Russia with a warm water port, which the overarching goal of Russian Naval foreign policies. It's something that Russia has in virtually no other part of its country and needs overseas expansion for. Syria with its dependence on Russia is one of the only countries that has been willing to provide this. Note, by the way, that leasing a military base requires a stable Assad government to be willing to provide this, something that Israel fundamentally does not want.",constructive1,5.0,jk2793,round9,jk2793_round9,1.0,
1644,"Secondly, economic importance. Things like control over pipelines, control over sector of the economy, public goods and stuff like that is something Russia currently has control over but is less likely to have control over if a government is significantly weak. Only a stable Syrian state had the capacity to provide this for Russia contrary to long term interest of Israel, and not only is Assad the only person who was able to provide this stability. Note that it is the only person who is willing to provide the benefits of the stability to Russia because virtually everyone else in the conflict is funded by the CIA and the Saudis. Meaning that this is Russia's only capacity to gain the structural benefits it wants from Syria. Will this start World War 3? No. For all the reasons I explained, the incentive Russia has in Syria is significantly stronger than the incentive Russia has in Israel. My appeal by, the one on Ukraine, kind of demonstrate this. America had a security commitment to Ukraine. Russia has much deeper structural reasons to want to destabilize Ukraine. America did not start World World 3. Secondly, note by the way, that if their argument is odd, the U S will retaliate. Note this logic works both ways because the U S knows that if it retaliates or Israel retaliates, then it has the possibility of starting World War 3, which means that the U S itself could put pressure on Israel to back up. Note, by the way, that the fact that the only they have is the possibility of a U S response demonstrates the implicit weakness of the Israeli bargaining position on our side of the house.

So as the opening government points out, the conflict is essentially winding down the rebels and oppositions have got owned and they're losing control over most major territory, cities, they're gradually winding down. The major interest now is essentially called a post-conflict settlement in Syria will be arranged and what the postwar Syria government and economy will look like. The level of control that the Syrian Russian Iranian Alliance has over Syria will determine leverage. Both in the amount of territory they hold, but also in the territory that they hold the amount of control they have. That is to say Israel's actions necessarily undermine the Iranian Syrian Russian Alliance because not only are they providing air support to the rebels and undermining territorial gains, but in the places where the Iranians and Syrians have gained control that undermine their control there by bombing them. Means that, also important because the revolution government has below are some of the best soldiers on the Syrian side of the conflict, so undermining them provides a strong weakness. I'll take a few lines. No? Okay, cool. By ensuring Assad and Iran full or near total control over as much of Syria as possible, not undermined by Israel. It means Russia will have to make significantly less concessions if not, no concessions at all in whatever negotiations, if negotiations even happen to the Israel Saudi Arabia American alliance. It's especially important because even though the American nominal primary goal in Syria is the removal of Assad ,note that they've essentially given up on this goal because every attempt they've tried to do it has failed. It means that to the extent that the United States and Israel and Saudi Arabia has any leverage in the post-conflict negotiation, that leverage will be used to try to minimize Russian influence because they know they can't get rid of Assad. It means that this is exactly the scenario Russia needs to counter. Russia has longterm incentives in ensuring that they have a stake in Syria, militarily, politically, and economically, and only by strengthen and negotiating their side to the maximal extent possible.

Before I move on to the extension. Why is the definition of special necessarily meaning best? As Justin mentioned before, apparently all of us are special. Why can't more than one person be special if all of us are special in our own ways? Special by definition means you're better than others.

So moving on- Not taken. Why is it harmful for these individuals when they're unable to accept it when they're older? Most kids grow up to have either average grades or do things like nine to five jobs and things like that. Not taken. They dwell in unsatisfaction because they are unable to accept that they aren't exceptional. Meaning the problem is majority is looked down upon within society. In society, you as an individual are only celebrated when you are unique and you are different from majority.

The people living in your area just at least see housing prices go up over time, indefinitely and permanently into the future.

This leads to homelessness, gentrification, people being driven out their homes. People not being able to afford rent, or even if they do afford rent, they can't afford anything else like education and healthcare and this is the major problem that we need to solve.

1414,"So first, children are inherently the most vulnerable group of a society. They have no agency and they exist in a state where they have to exist as the result of something else. So children don't make their own decisions. Decisions are made for them, but in certain situations, the decisions are not made by the parents rather made by the institutions and the society within which we exist. What I'm talking about here is how lower income families traditionally have almost no access to childcare and even if they do, it's often lower quality and not done in a way that supports the interests of the children or the parents. In the status quo there is no supplementary childcare. Everything is paid for out of pocket and this gets very problematic in a lot of different situations. The biggest one is in medical support. Childcare inherently means getting access to medical support and access to education and then access for parents to be able to interact with their children when they want to. The reason why the medical support issue is so bad is when you are in your formative years, there are many things that can affect your development. In many cases not getting the right amount of nutrients can actually severely damage you growing up and this house doesn't want to see that. For example, in Ecuador and Uganda, there are currently numerous problems being associated with children not being able to get enough calcium in their diet, which means they have weaker bone structures, but also means they start developing kidney problems and eyesight problems as early as seven. That's terrifying. This house addresses that problem.",constructive1,3.0,ls5871,round2,ls5871_round2,1.0,78.0
1415,"The second point I want to get in this point is that the privatization of this industry is inherently bad. The best example I can cite for this is the preschool industry in New York City where you have these parents who are forced to pay $20,000 to $30,000 a year just so their children can get a preschool education. That is ridiculous and it's inherently inequitable because the only people who can afford that are the wealthy. But as the government and as any rational person would say, we have to care about all children, not just the children of the wealthy, and that's what we address. I'm going to move into a subpoint of this, which is parents also have needs. It's been proven that when parents can't consistently form bonds with the children, it leads to a lower quality of life for the parent, as well as the child. And in a world without support for childcare, there is no support structure that allows parents to, I don't know, take time off work so they can be with their children or be able to leave their job if they have to go to school to help their child. There is no support for that and that's inherently bad. But secondary education, this is where I get into my second point, it exists in systems without governmental support for it. Private institutions have persisted since the 1400s and they do so by first of all the amount of wealth that they themselves can levy as a private institution, which means they don't need governmental assistance. They don't. They have wealth. And second of all, loan programs still exist, even if the government doesn't have the resources to give loans, there are still privatized loans. And I know what opposition is going to say is that these privatized loans are either predatory or that they have bad interest rates.

So landmark companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, all of them are actually reducing their requirements for traditional post-secondary degrees. And instead focusing on applicants who have experience precisely because they understand that it is an inequitable system to require everybody to have a post-secondary degree, that's just not feasible. And as a result, we can see that many companies are moving away from this, yet children are still going to be children.  They're still going to need access to their parents. They're still going to need medical care and they still need education. That's not going to change. And it's going to change for the worst if you take away any funding that you could possibly give to these children. And the side that wins this debate is the side that supports the most vulnerable groups. And I believe opposition is going to attempt to tell you that students are vulnerable, but children are far more vulnerable than post-secondary students. And that is why we have not only the moral obligation to help them, but also from a point of ethics we can't let children be underrepresented in society.

Note how frequently poor kids have systematic health issues that emerge at a really young age that can lead to disabilities later in life, that then have to be treated over the life course, such as lead poisoning, which frequently happens to kids who grow up inner cities, they get lead poisoning when they're, like, two and it's never cared for. I think solving that's a pretty good thing.

So, they're like, ""You should drop out of high school so you can start making some money, because we all need to take care of grandma. I think this happens less when your entire family has been taught to value your education from a very young age. When your entire family is like, ""Hey, your education is free. We should value it. We should care if you're getting it. The government's telling us it's important because they're fucking paying for this shit, so we should all care. We should let you at least finish high school or middle school, even. I think this creates an incentive in which the longer you stay in education, the more invested you become, especially if it's a thing that you're enjoying. I think, insofar as this is true, you get more people who value their education or who are more likely to try and go to higher level institutions even if necessarily they might have to take out loans to go there, I'm not taking any more also, just so you know, to take out student loans, I think they might think it's more worth it, that they might be more likely to also apply for scholarships that they might've previously not done because they might not have thought they were qualified for them or because they would have qualified for them.

But we think, however, when you get more kids coming up through the occasions from every level, school at the individual level will prioritize more resources to poor kids. They'll be like, ""It wasn't just one kid in my class who couldn't come to school today because he has go to work, it's 15."". We need to solve this communication. These kids are getting school lunches. We need to make sure they're getting more money. We think this leads to like better institutions, overall, for these kids.

That's the conception of hard work, leading to success being legitimate. But that ignores the reasons why people are more capable of doing hard work. Questions of ability and questions of circumstance, the wealth you grew up in? I think that this means that you're unlikely to actually have an understanding of what means,... Why the conception of hard work and capitalist society is flawed. I think if you tell kids, everyone deserves something, you're likely to wonder why, what is that discrepancy between what this person deserves and what they have. Because everyone deserves the same access to resources. No, just raise your hand. I'll see you. I think notably the problem is that this means that kids are going to grow up to be people who oppose things like affirmative action. Appose things like massive taxation and the wealthy because of you and your parents worked for things and you deserve things. Then why should those things be taken away? You deserve the maximum amount of yourself. I think this means that then you're unlikely to understand these barriers that exist and are likely to want to agitate to change the system. Notably there's a big wave of socialism right now that I think could actually be a successful thing in changing the minds of people in the future. Youth tend to be, I'm going to be down a lot more progressive in their views and able to overturn structures of capitalism, even if it's just small steps like universal healthcare. I think that is massively hindered when children are brought up in a way that tells them they deserve the things they have, and this is very hard to then account for why they should lose those things to help other people. It's a new liberal excuse to allow bad policy once you're in an adult to say, well, I deserve things. I'm capable and I have those things.

The fact that you're failing on the capacity to deserve everything is because you are somehow you made a failure along the way, because, you were perfectly capable to achieve that thing that you deserve. I think this is really hurtful for people because, first of all, you've been told that you, especially, capable that removes nuance and barriers. For example, people of color, women who have harder tens in getting jobs and things like that. But I think it also means that you might just not be as capable. I have the disability who thinks a lot slower than everyone else. This means I'm not going to succeed in the same aspect. You look at an office job and I think that's fine, but I need to understand that I'm going to have the capacity to succeed in this world. I think to tell someone that they're equally capable, but then they notice that there are limitations, for example, on mental health into their capacity to succeed. Because, it's not productive to their way to be able to cope for those things. Notably when you need to be able to do, is to access convictions and self advocate, but you cannot do that.

This means I spend many years sinking debt into med school and never actually achieve something meaningful advances in my life. People make bad choices. People don't reach out to the combinations of the need to account for things that might limit their capability, and this is problematic for their success in life. But all the reputation we didn't already do, I think they tell us that self-esteem is good because you say you're special, you become special.

When you give people complacency as to the reasons why these things are limited. I don't understand what it's going to be nuanced in the scenario. I think there needs to be a lot more work to prove why you didn't have a narrative, that somehow accounts for the barriers that exist for people and doesn't make people self-blame when they end up failing those expectations.

Empirically, it shows that abortions are safer and they're much better for the women on the whole and for the child being brought into this world.

Studies have come out that people of different political ideologies actually just spend less time together, and that's a big thing.

A lot of times political discourse can lean to a divided Congress or a divided government, and because of that it can be very very difficult to pass meaningful legislation that actually attacks these issues. A lot of times important issues can be reviewed over and over again because there can be a divide in the government, and that can lead to a lot of difficulty in passing bills that actually attacks these.

If someone has had all this huge background and someone doesn't have that big of a background knowing about these politics, I think that conversation is going to be really hard. But if it's mainly objective and we recognize the facts in the lace, then that will be credible, and about facts, right? You see even the speech after all these political speakers, there are fact checkers and the speeds come on and a lot of times what they say is false. I think people often blom onto that and I think if there was more objectivity, things would be fact-based and decisions would be made off what is true instead of what people hear. People often hear things and become emotional about it, but that's not necessarily the truth. And we think that's detrimental. For example, let's just imagine a hypothetical. Somebody grew up in a family that was racist, right? You grow up in a family that your parents do not like people of a different color, right? And then you grow up thinking that and you see a candidate who is very qualified but they fit that bill of being a different race and you don't support them because of your family bias. Right? People are inherently tethered to biases that they grow up with. And we think that leads to them skewing opinions when it could be they're ignoring the facts. We also can think someone got screwed over by a company, right? And then there's a candidate running who used to work in that company too, and they're not going to support them even if they're qualified just because their personal experiences hold them back.",constructive2,,mswan,round3,mswan_round3,1.0,78.0

There are three reasons why it increases wealth inequality. First, it increases wealth inequality between people. So taxes affect people on the margins most. I'll give you a clear example. If a wealthy person owns a mansion, they also probably can pay for whatever tax is going to be. They have a large amount of wealth, and they're not spending it all on the mansion. They're spending a small fraction of their total wealth on this mansion that's why they feel inclined to buy it. A person of middle income who owns a small house, they probably spent a vast more portion of their income, and a vast greater proportion of their savings trying to purchase this house, which means they have less money left over to pay that tax. So what we have left is a system where people who are middle income, who own small homes, these are the people who are unable to pay the tax while rich people who have mentioned are able to pay the tax.",constructive2,,pmanisca,round1,pmanisca_round1,1.0,77.0

1354,"the mother. This obviously creates a horrible power dynamic where the mother is wholly responsible for the child due to no fault of her own. But the third reason why society unfairly burdens women with child care is that there's this unfair expectation that women must sacrifice in order to have a greater prosperity for society at large. It's societally acceptable that women are to suffer for the benefits of society as a whole. As a result of that, these individuals, women, are often burdened with child care because it's deemed okay for them to suffer for the benefit of the child. So why must the state correct this burden? There are three reasons. First, is that the state is complicit in patriarchy. That's because the state has set up many sexist policies in the past and in the status quo. For example, denying women the right to vote, or denying them ownership of land. As a result of this, the state is directly culpable in the spreading of patriarchy, and as a result of that culpability, they must fix some harm that they created. Even if they didn't create the norm around child care being the primary burden of women, by fixing that harm by providing child care and give women an option not to just go and leave their job and focus on the child at home, it helps that harm. And therefore, they are somewhat making up for the harm in the past. But secondly, we would argue that having child care denied is infringement on a right in and of itself. Why is that the case? If you are a woman and you are denied child care, that means that your autonomy is violated because you have to give up your own choices, your own career, to go back and raise that child at home. If child care wasn't denied and you have the option to have your child placed in child care and to go back to live your job, your autonomy wouldn't have been violated. And as a result, you would be perfectly normal. As a result of this rights violation, we believe the state must step in and correct for that rights violation because it's happening right in front of their very eyes. And I'll take you. Yes?",constructive1,,pmanisca,round2,pmanisca_round2,1.0,78.0
1355,"Yes, it is true that most of these pressures are from norms. But on the margins, when child care would make a difference, we believe that taking away that child care is an infringement on women's rights, and giving it somehow helps. Even if it doesn't solve all the problems, it's still a marginal benefit to women, which we believe is very important. And also, our third argument actually explains why we get rid of those norms in the long run, because when we normalize child care, it creates liberation for women. So why is that the case? People in the status quo, they stigmatize child care. They believe that women who have jobs, and have careers, and put their children in child care are not being very motherly. And as a result, are doing some disservice to society. We believe that when the state sponsors child care, and pushes their heart and soul behind it, more minds and ideas are changed. Why is that the case? We believe that the state is the ultimate bully pulpit. They decide the norms of society, not just in Western liberal democracies like the United States, but also around the world. For example, in China, if the CCP says something, most people are going to follow along with that idea. And as a result, we believe the state is a key actor in the formation of norms. So if the state says it is acceptable for women to put their children in child care facilities, more and more people will begin to accept that. And as a result, we see more women not staying home and taking care of their child, but rather pursuing careers, which further liberalizes them, further generates more wealth and independence within women, which we believe is uniquely important. Look, biology and horrible societal norms have pushed women into this corner, but we believe that child care is the unique and only way to lift that unique patriarchy that woman suffer.

Quebec only has a few cities that it can draw money from, but the entirety of Canada has multiple ports and other cities that they can take taxes from. Often these discriminatory laws are implemented in places that have less income and less money associated with them. That is because religious bigotry and other types of discriminatory behavior are often seen in these areas that don't have a lot of interaction and who aren't liberalized, who aren't like the coastal elite places.

So what this means then is that... I think that it isn't not for us to prove to you why it's the case that specifically tell your kid in a comparative way that they all be different from others around them, because they are inherently special means that you're able to feel suppressive and push them into marginalized ideals of role fulfillment on the basis of what you as a parent believe.It means that you as a parent are able to project bias mindsets that you might have, when otherwise, if you just push forth to your kid this mindset that they could fulfill things but you don't prepare what they can fill to what other people can fulfill. We think it means it's more open for your kid to interpret what you can do but also means that your kid can draw off of what other parents tell their children they can do.

It's a case that the state's not doing a good enough job regulating the differences in early childhood development. Why is investing more money not going to solve this? For a couple of reasons. One, we believe the rich will always have more access to the levers of power to get better for their shoulder, no matter how much money you've probably spent in the system to equalize it. We believe the rich have better networks of access, no matter how much you give to lower income people. The families of the rich will always have the best nannies, the best healthcare services, the best, et cetera. But third, even when people get access to basic resources equally, there are still rich students get more of it because of the nature of capitalism, right? How do we solve back this educational inequality, these very foundational inequalities? The first is that the comparative is that there's no equality in a childcare system, no matter how much public funding goes towards it. But the second is that you get targeted spending across systems that are already meant to be more equal. So that's say you get more spending in the public education sector, you get more spending in trade schools, get more spending in... you get more spending in private health, private education systems.

I just told you the most important economic impact of this round is the student loan prices, but I leave the motion, but this one is going to go a little bit differently, right?

How to write, how to engage in certain patterns of thoughts. When you fall behind in those developments, when you feel that you have difficulty reading in earlier grades, then you come to believe that you are bad at school and you have difficulty learning, and when you believe that you are not good at those things, there comes to be a cycle of self-validation where you believe you are not good at it, so you come to become worse at it. That does not happen in communities where children have more care applied to them because then, the narrative in poor communities is that a large amount of people are just not good enough and they are not made for this. They're not born for this, but in communities with the actual ability to afford that care, they are told that falling behind is not their faults and all they have to do is spend more time and have people spend more care upon them to actually catch up. While in poor communities, they are told that they cannot catch up because that's not who they are. We think that's a tragedy that can be fixed when we find things better and are able to provide better care. When we free parents to send their kids to better care or subsidized care such that parents can get better care.
I think that when we improve the ability for parents to actually care about the formative years and children get the messaging that they needs to be told and this creates a better platform for them to move forward?

The second claim I'm going to today is that minority religious communities tend to be a bigger political constituency and sub national units than they are at the national level because they tend to be concentrated in a particular area. So for example, a minority of Muslim community is more of a constituency in the Southern area of Thailand than it is in the Northern area of timeline. Right. So at that point, we think that these governments that are closer to these communities probably had more incentive not to make policy that reflects the dominant, prevailing religious or cultural attitudes within their country to the exclusion minorities because those minorities aren't more important part of their political constituency. At a more local level. The third thing to say is that people are generally more connected to governments of the local level. It is easier to know who represents you. It is generally easier to participate in the process and stay informed about the process. You feel more connection to it in real life. And that means that you generally have more ability to have a say. We broadly think that the process and ensuring what religious Liberty looks like is more democratic. I just saw national level and the fourth thing to say is that cultural divisions about what religious Liberty looks like are often some of the premise of these sub national divisions, right? So we think one of the premises of combat being a division that is separate from the rest of Canada is this French heritage and this idea of Lacy PEI. So the fact that it is split apart in this way, easy part, competent to the fact that they have different cultural values to some extent that reflects different notions of what religious freedom should be.

We agree that things like welfare are often very centralized and often these services are highly integrated, so that means that when you come off this funding, you'll hurt people, hurt people who didn't consent into these religiously violated policies. In fact, you are most likely are perky religious minorities that they care the most about protecting both because the government has any of that province or state has an incentive to shift the cost onto those communities and because they're likely to be marginalized or vulnerable in those, in those sub national units for other reasons. But second, you explain the cultural reasons why people care about their different policies, right? So provincial politicians in Quebec, for example, can now rail against the federal government and indeed minority religious communities. In the worst case, this could lead just a session referenda. And can you imagine the result of the succession referenda predicated explicitly on this idea of being oppositional is going minority religion within the sub national unit? I think that would be a terrible result. I think this is a policy that hurts people. I don't think they can be so live when they say, well, it's going to work because people are going to default to their economic interests. Look, people are willing to pay enormous costs for things that they culturally care about. What's a better method?

I think that when you have this idea you have abilities, that you have potential, you're, one, less afraid to try things for fear of failure. And, two, you are more motivated to find something that you are particularly good at, to find something that lets you tap into that specialness, that lets you tap into that sense of destiny. We think it's just good, in a practical sense, that is to say it gives children a leg up. They get a variety of experiences that they can parlay things later in life. But we also think it gives them early experience in discovering some identity, some sense of who they are. Because it's important to try things and not like those things. It's important to try on different roles as a child and reject some of those roles, and learn how to grow and change as a person with different things that you do over time.

I think that the idea that children bring something special, that they are valuable in and of themselves, makes them more confident to engage with other children as well. It makes them more able to engage in those social situations and find out who they are.",constructive1,5.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0

Because when you have this idea of potential, you want to fulfill that potential, so you want to spend time practicing whatever it is that you care about. We think that's good, in that it teaches you certain skills. It teaches you the value of perseverance. It teaches you hard work. We also think it is good, in that in the absence of you being intrinsically motivated, we think your parents might be likely to push you in ways that might not be desirable. Because your parents still want you to succeed and be exceptional. But we think a better, on the comparative, way to motivate that is by inculcating in the children some sense that their work will pay off because there is something special about them, rather than having to push them in ways that might strain that relationship.",constructive2,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1713,"The third claim that I'd make about why it's good to believe you're special as a child, is that it sets a certain moral standard. It sets an expectation of how you will act in the world. And the idea being that specialness is holistic, that is to say, you are special as an agent, as a person. And there is something about that specialness which means that you have some responsibility to act in such a way that is dignified and that befits your status. So, why do I think all of this really matters from the position of child? Because we think that people can and do develop more sophisticated moral systems later. The important thing as a child is that they have confidence, that they have the ability to learn basic social skills and to explore basic things about their identity, and to explore basic things about who they are. That's what allows them to develop more sophisticated moral systems later. Yeah.",constructive3,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0

We think that liberation is a process, and that is to say we think that it is important to be told in the home that you are valuable, that you are deserving of things just the same as anyone else. That you can be special just the same as anyone else. And we think that is the way that you learn how to practice demanding things that will make you more assertive and more able to exercise that identity later in life. I would note two additional implications of this arguments about what the world says. The first, is that some children will think they're special anyway because the world's going to tell them that because of their identity characteristics. So the harms of them thinking they're special in that way aren't unique. The second, is that [if off 00:00:05:13] is going to say it's really bad for children to feel special because they're going to step on all the other children. Note, that when their world from a very young age is competitive, when they're world from very young age is putting them into contact with other people who might be better at certain things, we think the messages at home serve a counterbalancing effect. That is to say, they will think that they are special in some senses and not in others because the world is telling them one thing and they're learning another thing at home. So, the impact of internalizing this message fully is mitigated to some extent. But, particularly the unique impact here is, people that wouldn't otherwise feel that someone is telling them that they're special. We think it's important that they get that at home.",constructive4,4.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0
1715,"Finally, I want to talk about what happens as you grow older and how you sort of take this concept of specialness with you, because they're going to say that, in time you've learned that maybe you aren't special in those particular ways. But I think that this concept of specialness is still valuable. The first is as a totem of your parents' love. It is important because it signals that you were special to them and you can be special to other people. You can be loved and you can be deserving of that choice, conferring a certain specialness upon you, because of some ineluctable quality of humanness that is within you. I think it allows you to have deeper relationships with your parents as you grow older, because it's one of the very early... It's an incredibly profound way that from a very early age, you know that you're special to them. But second, I think, in the longterm, you learn that everyone is special, because everyone is human and values different things and has a rich and subjective and irreducible quality of life. So maybe that isn't how you would understand specialness when you're an unnuanced child. But in time, when you get passed over for promotions or all of the other things that is going to tell you happen, you think about what your parents said and you realized they weren't entirely wrong. I am special. There is something about me that matters, because there is something about everyone that matters. That's how the concept of specialness grows with you and makes you a more complete moral person in the long term. Propose.",constructive5,5.0,sgreenberg,round6,sgreenberg_round6,1.0,84.0

I mean that you can use statistics all day long to say that the illegal abortions are more unsafe to the woman. That there is the constitutional understanding, a legalistic view that abortions should be legal, but it fails to actually capture the emotional nuance of life lived experience that that woman goes through. There is no statistic to show the hardship that it was to make the decision to have an abortion. There is no statistic that can actually give you this view. So we think that when we were talking about political discourse and what gives better debates, that if we include this more nuanced understanding of how these issues are affecting people then I think we get deeper and richer debates. my second point about why numbers doesn't actually elicit the response that gets y'all to the back half.",constructive1,,smcdade,round3,smcdade_round3,1.0,77.0

That is to say that throughout our day-to-day lives we're constantly bombarded with ""50 people died here"", ""50,000 people died here"", ""200 people died here"", that we become numb and we don't actually imagine the magnitude of what it means to have that numbers. Right? What do I mean by this? I mean that when I'm given just this random, big number, that now I just can wash it off and I don't internalize it as an actual human died; that 50 people actually died. It's much easier to see a number and think of it only as a number without seeing the human cost behind it. So we think that when we're talking about political debates and we're talking about the fact that these are about statistics and objectivity.

Right? What do I mean by this? I mean that as long as we are having this objectivity narrative and that that's what's going to be needed in this debate, we're always going to have racist people who are subjectively interpreting these things. So what do we see? We see that objectivity can't actually capture...  I know. Objectivity captures all the... Objectivity fails to capture all the human experience. It actually masks the human call and the subjectivity behind it. And, it can be used as a racist dog-whistling as long as subjective people are interpreting these ""objective statistics."" So what actually changes when we're doing this? When we're including these human experiences? We think we allow for richer, more human connection for that person. What do I mean by this?

I think it's important to understand this, if you want a real-world example, in the gay marriage movement. Right? We see a clear delineation before 2005 and after 2005 where the gay marriage movement was Before 2005, it was legalistic, it was all around constitutionality, and around why this is a right and they were trying to play it objectively. They saw no change in people's actually-perceived ideas about why gay marriage should be legal. We saw no shift in public opinion. But after 2005, we saw subjectivity come into the world where people actually showed that gay couples are couples and that their lived experiences are valid.

These are things that people actually will get told in the world where we believe in this type of thing. Then, I think that most of it has just been implicitly responded to by the fact that the thing that we are negating on silent positions, the very idea of there being inherent characteristics, but I just, therefore, want to illustrate an example that illustrates how this Rosa Parks, sitting on a bus, was a denial of inherent speciality, the denial of inherent speciality for white people.

Also. So what does this mean? I think we give you examples. It means you under weigh people who aren't like you that is foreign policy decisions get a lot worse because you're never going to be interviewing this Yemeni child. You just drop a drone strike because you can't fully empathize with the subjective experiences. But you can empathize with subjective experience that people who are like the subject of terror attacks at home, it means you under weigh victims. That is to say you never listen to victims of sexual assaults because you always think, ""Oh that can't happen to me."" Or ""Oh, it's her fault for dressing slutty."" And you're a lot more likely to empathize with your white side and who could be falsely accused of rape. Even if the statistics say that only 1.5% of rape allegations are false, you always are never emphasizing with victims because you can never see yourself as being one of those victims. But we also think that Will tells you that there's a gender or racialized conception of who has the ownership of certain emotions. That is to say if we always think of women as being able to be the victims, this could actually be a very bad thing. Meaning when white woman accused a black man of rape, they have the monopoly on the sympathy emotion of being able to appeal to that. But when a black man or a black family is a victim of police brutality, they can't access these emotional appeals in the same way. And when you increase the magnitude of that subjectivity in discourse, people will always listen to the white female victim or like the white police officer who they are a lot easier to empathize with when things like objectivity, how many people are actually the subject of police brutality or like the fastest particular case are glossed over by the media.",constructive1,,srbaxi,round3,srbaxi_round3,1.0,79.0

First, I don't think they necessarily give you warrants for why this is the case when Will provide you at least some tools, why it's easier to access objectivity than subjectivity if people are going to be dismissing our subjective experience out of hand. That is to say like when they bring up the case of Flint Michigan, the presence of led in the water is an objective fact and not a subjective experience that people can just dismiss. He brings up the thing about like critical studies departments, but I think a great example of this is Brown V Board. That is to say you didn't desegregate schools because people didn't care or listen to black children who felt bad about having to go to segregated schools. The way you got school desegregation was when critical race departments presented research in the Supreme Court where kids who went to segregated schools thought black dolls were literally worse or uglier than white dolls.

When you rely on objectivity, you at least make it a little bit easier for minorities to be able to say, ""Oh, but the magnitude is so great that we ought to do something about it.""

Religion is the lens through which people give meaning to their lives and when you infringe on religious liberty, it is tantamount to depriving their life at any meaning whatsoever.

One, the connection that you made from university to individuals from the class are necessary to succeed in the class. Two, there are industry requirements, I.e. if you want to be an elite in business, you have to have a certain business degree to be able to get your introductory job. And three, the degree themselves acts as some kind of a signal of your capability to be involved with the elite class. University is in fact the tipping point at which a low income individual is able to join an elite class in some sense. I.e. people who are low income individuals are able to go to Oxford, still become judges, lawyers and politicians. The people that are able to have large scale implements. This is the most important impact in the round. If we're able to take even a small number of low income individuals that otherwise wouldn't have gone to university and put them into positions of power as policymakers, legislators and judges, those are people that now have the background to understand the issues that low income individuals face. Those are the people that are most likely to advocate for increasing funding that goes towards early child education and post-secondary education for low income students. Those are people that are creating the longterm change that they're trying to fight for. This is most important impact from the round.
One additional piece we think is important to point out is that government money that goes towards universities isn't just going towards the direct education themselves. It also has important spillover effects into research that we think are really critical. Particularly in non-profitable areas of research, there's a public policy, education and psychology that don't happen to your business impacts and lead to poor profit funders not funding them. Research in these areas only happens, even at really elite universities, where there's sufficient outside funding to fray the cost of hiring the researchers, hiring the students as RAs and having enough of a classroom teaching environment that they have the other university resources to be able to have powerful research departments in the first place.

1519,"But moving into the new extension, which is how exactly states are going or not going to comply. We're going to contend at our extension that states are very unlikely to comply when these are actually implemented. Part of the reason for this is exactly what Jimbo tells you in his last speech, which is if you're sufficiently able to predict that there will be economic harms to violating your voting for a policy that's going to violate religious freedoms, then you might choose not to vote for it. I.E. Those that are able to analyze economic beliefs and prioritize those over the radicalized religious or moral views are already going to be voting against this policy in the first place. The first reason, then, that states are unlikely to comply with this kind of enforcement is that their decision calculus hasn't changed. They are already aware of the financial harms prior to enacting it. Nothing has changed, we're getting the exact same financial harms that the government had promised with that one to two year period the opening government so kindly models for us. And in addition, we think that the states are going to be doing this are likely to be self-selecting for those that are financially economist regions, I.E. Those that are revenue positive rather than the federal government. Otherwise, they would unlikely make such a decision. For example, if you look at Catalonia, Catalonia is relatively revenue positive compared to Spain, so there's less of a net harm to having this funding cut off. There has been no team on side government bench that has explained why that decision calculus flips after the fact. I need to hear a lot more work on that to believe anybody's going to flip. Secondarily, I think that consistently people are more likely to vote off of radicalized beliefs than economic harms. Necessarily, the states that we're talking about are those in which the individuals hold what we would consider in this room to be radicalized views on what exactly religion is, and what religious liberties are. We think that and they probably prioritize those over economic harms given that they voted for this. ",constructive1,4.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0
1520,"Why is it that when this is implemented, that it's actually likely to get worse? First, we think there's an element of attribution. This was mentioned by our opening, that is that we're likely to blame the minorities, but wasn't fully mechanized. What we will you tell you then, is not only do they then blame the minorities, but as a result, that becomes further reason to then block those liberties. That is, if I think that the reason that my funding has been cut off is because of the religious expression of my Muslim neighbor, I'm now more likely to support harming the rights of my Muslim neighbor because I think that they're the ones that are directly responsible for the harms that I and my children are suffering. Secondarily, you'd think that since there are no actual economic benefits to banning these liberties in the first place, it necessarily means that when this decision was initially made, it was a non-economic decision. Third reason, the states are unlikely to comply. That's private support or the victim card. In other words, we think there was a substantial number of people, both within these states and outside of them, that support the radicalized view towards religion that they're taking on and want to be able to vote their independence. Particularly given that these are likely to be smaller regions relative to the total size of the country, because if there were larger regions, they would likely account for a larger voting block within the federal governments, which would then mean the federal government would be the one arbitrating in their favor. We think it's likely then, that there would be a potential for very wealthy, conservative millionaires and billionaires to contribute enough to keep these states solvent, even if they are revenue negative. For these reasons, we have a very time believing that states are going to comply. ",constructive2,5.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0
1521,"What is then going to be the response? We see a few possibilities. One possibility we think is very likely is that these states stop paying taxes. I'm not going to take it. Likely that they stop paying taxes, particularly because they're likely to be revenue positive, as we mentioned before. In addition, we think that they need to stay solvent. Cutting off taxes is one way to stay solvent. And in addition to that, there's now no incentive to pay taxes. I.E. The government has lost all of its leverage to enforce taxation and you're not going to pursue a military invasion, given this is more likely to happen in mountain country where you have a weaker federal government, otherwise it would have already been enforced. And because military invasions on a domestic front are always going to be unpopular. Why is it really, really bad if they stop paying taxes? One, all of the funding drops. This is actually implicitly dropping [OG from the debate. Here, their entire pace was contingent on having an increased amount of funding that then goes towards other groups once we know we're getting enough money off tax revenue, OG's out. But secondarily, it leads to further radicalization because now the government has literally no leverage. There is no financial relationship between the two, which allows them to radicalize further. I'll explain this more in a moment when we move to the second possibility, which is the secession. In many of these states, such as Quebec, which has already tried to vote for secession twice in the last four years, there's an active secession movement. Okay, secession is likely to happen because one, these are probably safe, so already one has a seat because they're ideologically opposed to the federal government. And secondarily, we think that this amplifies radical ideological differences. That is, that because religion is a fundamental belief, once you create an oppositional relationship about the radical beliefs with the government, you increase the incentive to withdraw.",constructive3,4.0,thecactus,round5,thecactus_round5,1.0,80.0

We think that's a big example where we think that you need to understand that sharing is a big part, especially like building up this community. But second of all recognizing the harsh nature of the world. So this long-term impact of like learning the importance of hard work, is essentially saying that you're not guaranteed everything in life. You're not always guaranteed a promotion, no matter how hard you work. We say then, that it's much more important to realize that there's still something to life outside of all of these achievements that you're going to get. Right?

1401,"Let's talk about the second extension that Jonathan gives you, which is this concept of rent and why it's the worst alternative. We tell you that the alternative is, and they can see this mega developers coming in because this motion is about personal home ownership, whose tax substantially increases, but corporate home ownership is not affected in this debate. And as such, we're going to get huge waves of individuals who are private owners selling their property, decreasing the prices of property, and as such, that's the perfect opportunity for these actors, these mega developers, to buy a large swath of property. This is the fundamental reason why they're more likely get monopolistic situations where they control the entire rental market that people are now dependent on. We think it's more coercive than middle-class landlords because they own so much property and you don't have the fluidity of moving to a different landlord who might be potentially better because there's this corporation that owns a large amount of land in this area or neighborhood, and as such, it's very easy to collude and to raise rental prices. We rather have the middle class get this money from the rent, then mega developers. But furthermore, something unique about renters means that they have no control because landlords can suddenly increase prices. Landlords can ignore when you need like your home fixed or something like that. If there's a pipe broken in your home, they can simply ignore that situation. They can cause renovations because renters are inherently very sticky. What do we mean by this? It means that it takes time for them to move from one area to another. There's a huge opportunity cost of getting a new truck to move all of your furniture, changing, your address, changing everything that your postal code has been associated with in the past and also moving your children from one neighborhood to another. This means that renters are likely to be more coerced and homeowners because they don't have control over what happens and their demand for that piece of property is hugely inelastic.

Because given that they have limited resources, that means they also have limited resources to give children medical care, limited resources to get parents to spend more time with their children. And those limited resources means that the impacts of this debate are entirely mitigated. But that's when you need to weigh the cost and benefits, we think the post-secondary degrees they say are more expensive, first we say comprehensive childcare and comprehensive, like, national childcare, comprehensive medical care for children is very expensive, if you want to take care of every single child of that lower income bracket. But secondly, trade school is far less expensive, even if they have to be subjected to a slightly less expensive form of post-secondary education. At least there's a higher likelihood that their children and their grandchildren are likely to climb up the social ladder, which you don't get on their side of the house when they just give zero to five education.

Especially in this class is very well the government's point on the idea that like as a renter, you're constantly in the state of a housing mobility. You're constantly trying to move around, evaluate your opportunities for what the cheapest possible alternative to where you're living is. I think having this process is even worse when you have predatorial rental practices on the part of large corporations. So I don't think you necessarily get to invest in your community, politically speaking, the way you would under a situation where you can actually own a house.

These are things that will be subjected under our side and let us have the ability to unite people because these are incidents that will get African Americans to come out here and vote. Note the system that African Americans and minorities believe in are already flawed. They believe governments alienate them. That is why without subjective accounts saying that the person besides you might be killed and therefore you should come out to vote, those individuals would never turn out to the voting poll, and that is a greatest atrocity to an entire democratic practices, because democracy is premised on the fact that individuals have equal say. The moment when I only care about philosophical or political goals of mainly the very highest class form of objectivity is a moment when these individuals will be put in trains and never have their say in a political system. The ways in which you should engage with them therefore, is to feed into the society saying that your friends or your family members might be killed by white police, and therefore you should come up here and vote.

Not only will the supply of total housing units not change, I do not see where the large increase of rent from there is coming from. Supply, then, is not fixed. Moreover, themselves who rapidly enter the rental market, to take advantage of the millions of new customers, creating a competition that defeats all those arguments about rising rents, which is critically on the subject that the number of LLCs and REITs is fixed. But what of the supply people entering money into the REIT market dramatically increases every VC in Toronto, San Francisco, New York City, and any other city is going to be massively pouring money into it, creating competition, and historically monopsonistic field that exists there. For a team, that most of the market is as much as opening opposition, their assumption of fixed supply is laughable. Secondly, we create meaningful competition with public housing. The origin out of the wealth tax, very much in the spirit of someone like, say, Elizabeth Warren, that we are creating, is a meaningful competition against the monopoly that certain areas have on housing units. Therefore, they cannot charge rents above that of the marginal production cost, which incidentally there is no device construction cost. It's just inaccurate. That competition drives the rents. Thirdly, the assumption zoning laws as a fixed is totally wrong. It's not exogenous, it is endogenous. Zoning laws changed why? Who supports zoning laws right now? Homeowners, because restricted zoning laws people of color, and poor people from entering neighborhoods, because they provide competition to their own house unit, therefore lowering the value of their property. The only people who oppose zoning laws right now are the homeowners themselves. Renters hate zoning laws because it rises and increases their rents. So millions of upper middle class and middle class people change from the homeowning market to the rental market.

Our first part of this, our financial bubbles for widened relations in Singapore global housing bubble that occurred in 2000 and 2007. There are three reasons why home ownership is a terrible savings vehicle that is not identified by the opening government. Number one, they are undiversified assets. If I'm going to spend $250,000 in a financial asset, I put it in multiple different kinds of undiversified, hopefully uncorrelated, different assets as insurance against fraud. You know what housing isn't? It's undiversified. It's all your units in one financial asset. If it falls, all your savings: totally gone. Number two, it's highly illiquid. The reason why rich people tend to prefer putting their savings in T-Bills certificates to the index funds is if you need to come up with cash relatively fast, you can sell them pretty fast and you'd get cash relatively fast. But the thing is, you'll see brokers large amount of time to sell your home and extract the equity, or you'll see brokers and financial managers take 25% each. The implicit response we get is that, while owning a home is a super easy way in which you can access capital, not true. There are hundreds of pages of legal documents and the fees from is enormously complicated. In contrast, wanted to get a treasury bill from, say, Royal Bank of Canada or, say, the Federal Reserve, it's incredibly easy. I can whip out my phone and do so.

If the value of that home ever falls, I don't know because of relative or any calculation of market, you've lost everything. We just the bottom 80% of the population in the United States has still not recovered since 2008. You create financial crisis. 

Why does this outweigh everything else? One, financial crises are far worse to destroying nest eggs than in the importance to switch from a homeownership to rental units. Two, financial crises typically harbor richer insurance, they could take advantage to make back their money, whereas financial crisis generally income has still not recovered. If we destroy the few nest eggs, which by the way I don't think we do because we're redistributing money, not throwing it up into thin air, we substantially prove that financial security of the poor.

Incidentally, another issue with homeownership is about neighborhood turnover. That is people are locked into their homes, which means they don't move with job prospects, get better different areas, because of the large fixed costs that identify in selling their large financial asset.

The problem is there's this to entries such as requiring a Bachelors degree to run a private daycare by which you can do so or people spending a lot of money because they want really high quality at a high tier early childhood education but with very little evidence by which it works.

Firstly, there is no meaningful substitute for accreditation, that is, even if you learn absolutely nothing in college which may be true for certain degrees, there's important stipulating values that exist for requiring a post secondary education degree. That is, they need to finish the degree to signal to employers that you are a capable employee. That you can finish school with decent grades and work hard. If you do not have that degree, it is very, very difficult to earn their market value. It suggests that the return investment from getting a college degree, is over the lifespan well over a million dollars. Secondly, they determine the elite within society. There's huge evidence of a large return in investment, and those who graduate from universities tend to be those who had a fast track towards the degrees by which society, of course respects. And there is no meaningful alternative that you can get at a lower provision of services. Unless you attend the certain subset university of accredited universities by which you do so. There is pre-requisite of making sure that your child gets a good education. Thirdly, there's strong evidence that high parental education improves their child's lives. So you want to improve the kind of quality education Prime Minister talks about, there is no substituting for doing so. Importantly, there is strong evidence that additional public funding can push people through school. There is strong evidence to suggest that if people have a few more dollars, then things like textbooks, making rent or etc, that push people to drop out of school, therefore forfeit the millions of dollars of return investment they get in education, can be effectively enumerated by additional dollars provided by the government. This does not price up prices, because there's meaningful competition particularly outside in the upper tier schools that meaningfully differentiate prize.

Women's anger is often seen as illegitimate and even if you were allowed to introduce an anger or other emotions into political discourse, it's not likely those anger will be seen as legitimate anger. Which means the kind of anger that will be seen as socially acceptable is more likely to be the kind of anger weaponized by people like Donald Trump when he reels against certain groups, then it has to be likely to be other kinds of groups. We know, for example, from debate, the white male voices are consistently privileged when it comes to making ordinances. This is the group that we should care about the most.

Therefore, it is not a right that can be simply waived away in a balancing test and must require that it needs to be over-exuberant enforcement.  In fact, if you're willing to overshoot in protection of liberty if necessary to do so because we imagine opening opposition will cite a few court cases that maybe went to far. One, it's because taking away liberty is hard to give that liberty back then once you have already taken it away, and secondly, the harms of under regulation are small compared to the huge concentrated effects of losses to those deeper numbers, so even if this results in over-exuberant enforcement of religious liberty, that is a bullet we are willing to bite.",constructive1,5.0,williamarnesen,round5,williamarnesen_round5,1.0,83.0

But if they start targeting Jews or Muslims, that actually might be politically popular, as a result in the- ... constitutional court infraction and automatically enforce that and why should do so. Secondly, meters can not be trusted to exercise discretionary power to enforce court rules because lack the incentive to appeal to majority religiosity as seen most of the US Republican Party. Thirdly, the counter majoritarian nature of courts is a feature, not a bug. We expect opposition to focus how courts are rather, say, anti-democratic and using their judgment is bad. This is in fact a feature, not a bug-... no thank you. Took one earlier... by which we can enforce these clauses. Second part of substantive, you need religious leaders to have faith in government institutions and is preserved. The reason religious organizations are so active in politics is they fear that if their preferred candidate does not win, the government is going to trample on their rights. The reason why we need powerful laws that enforce religious liberty laws is providing meaningful sets of securities as even though a Democrat wins or even though the Liberal Party wins in Canada, that their protections and their way of life is secure.  We think, for example, allowing private religious schools mean that religious groups are less likely to allow you to roll back sex education or birth control in every school secure in knowing that if that ever happened, they could always go to the private religious schools. It is important that you fight extraordinarily powerful protections, particularly in places where churches are strong like in Mexico or much of America to make sure that these religious leaders do not use their enormous power to weaponize and mobilize huge swaths of the population to affect, say, the rights of everyone else. You need strong religious protections to make sure that they feel secure that their way of life is secure and do not use that to try to affect the way of life of everyone. Religious liberty is a core feature of any form of constitutional democracy, and we currently lack sufficient protections and lack sufficient enforcement mechanism to preserve that liberty.

1539,"So number one: I'm going to talk about resolution analysis point number one, and that is talking about civil liberties. What are civil liberties? Well, civil liberties are essentially negative freedoms. Basically we have clauses and revisions and our state constitutions and our federal constitutions that say the federal government can't trounce us on these points. If they do, then the Supreme Court would get involved and there are various adjudication enforcement measures in order to make sure that states, federal governments, local government, in both Canada and the United States, will go ahead and say, ""Well actually you can't do that, the power doesn't exist. So we remove you from office, we'll stop you from doing so or we will choose not to enforce this decision coming from your state coat."" So there are means of adjudications, which ensure the negative liberties are protected via state constitution and federal constitution to both Canada and the United States.",constructive1,2.0,wylywalker,round5,wylywalker_round5,1.0,77.0
1540,"Moving now to my worlds analysis under my resolution analysis from two, we're talking about exactly the worlds that we're seeing here in the . So number one, we can go ahead and look at the opposition role. The opposition role is going to go by the main routes of adjudicating issues between the states and governments on civil liberty matters. So we're going to use the current system, the current way of dealing with these issues... We're going to adjudicate them. Here's a great example of exactly how it would happen the opposition in the world. A few years back after Obergefell was passed, there was this homophobic judge in Alabama and she essentially decided that she was not going to work according to Obergefell, when it became legal for people to get married to people of the same gender. So what she says, ""I'm not going to enforce this, I'm not going to officiate wagons."" She was removed from her position and the federal government stepped in and said, ""You can't actually do that because you don't have the power to do that because we've just decided that civil liberty under the first amendment."" So we can see here that adjudication is working in the current system and there are ways to do it without withholding funding, but I believe the government will like you to believe the only way we can have these sort of adjudications is by withholding funding from state governments to force politicians out of power to coerce them by making people really really mad at them for the things that they've done. But I'll have a couple points later on about why this idea is actually absolutely ridiculous and because politicians aren't just going to switch up overnight. Lately, the people that elected them to that place are going to stand by their original position which is removing the civil liberty from those people. So this is problematic in the government world no matter how you look at it, because withholding money from these people isn't going to make them change their mind on it. They're still going to believe what they believe, they're just going to be angry at you about it.  ",constructive2,3.0,wylywalker,round5,wylywalker_round5,1.0,77.0
1541,"""You don't have the power to do this because you're a state and you're violating the constitution."" So we'll go ahead and move down to talking about another context point and that is, what is federal funding? Where does federal funding go and who does it impact?  So number one: federal funding goes largely to schools, federal funding goes largely to roads, federal funding goes largely to emergency funds. It goes to hospitals, it goes to all of these various different things. We can see here is that you have two ways you can look at federal funding: either it doesn't matter and it's not going to sway the decision on the States or it does matter and it's going to harm people, if you actually remove the federal funding. I believe what the government team is going to say, ""We are going to harm people"", so they take the politicians out of office so they will tell our agenda. Now, I don't particularly like that. I do like civil liberties, but I don't like that idea and I think you're saying that we're going to harm the people to change the government. I don't think that's the way we can do it. I don't think that's the best way to do it and that's the government role you have for you, whereas you have with the opposition world, you can go through the basic means of adjudicating what we have today through the rule of law. So my first contention is basically talking about how this violates the basic precepts of both the founding of the United States and of Canada. This is a complete violation of how these governments were supposed to work. In the United States, we built a system where we have state governments, local governments, and the federal government and overall the federal government was supposed to have the constitution and then our negative liberties under there. We say, ""You can't violate these whether you're a local, state or federal government and you can't touch these things."" The Supreme Court decides where to and how to apply that law. Then decisions made by states will be adjudicated and said, ""No, you don't actually have the power to do that and we're going to stop you from doing that.""

1542,"So I'm going to go ahead and go down to my point number two, and it does basically is best to use the established means of adjudicating the metrics. This is one that are going to be one of our voting points for the bottom half opposition team here, is it's better to use other means of adjudication. Now let's say if there's absolutely no other place to go and the state government is not inclined with the federal government. There are needs and we've seen this in United States history and in the present which states had basically said, ""We aren't going to do what you want us to do."" That's called the Civil War. We got into the Civil War to stop them from violating liberties that the Supreme Court and that the federal government basically said, ""These are civil liberties and you are violating them."" It's time to stop, and there was enforcement. Withholding funding at that point would be a great tool, but that's not an issue that we see common today and so it's not really influential in the worlds that we're talking about in today ",constructive4,3.0,wylywalker,round5,wylywalker_round5,1.0,77.0
1474,"vastly outweighs it, but also note that in the status quo, and this is where we think we take down a lot of Bobo. Christians and the majority groups are already supported or catered to, because the state already has an incentive to get that vote because if they are the majority, it is already beneficial for them to pander to them and make sure that rights don't get violated or whatever. So what does this mean? Right? I think this means that this discrimination they talk about is already dealt with in status quo and the States would never fight this battle because they also rely on the majority of the Christian populace. So they would definitely concede to whatever demands are being done without having their economics like support being stripped away. So we don't think that's really in the clash of this debate. What do we then think this is about? And I think then it becomes about groups that are currently marginalized. I often ethnic, I've no religious groups specifically in the developing world who are often denied rights based on histories of that region or characteristics that go beyond the religion and I think that what this does that has set the stage to once it's clear that the federal government will not interfere in the issues of the state and now becomes easy for the state to continue to implement other discriminatory factors beyond just like limiting their rights. Religion. I literally doing what China's and rounding up these people in concentration camps and deciding to like literally start committing genocide, but then at the point of which there are, they know that there's no retaliation coming from the state. They also wants to cater to this majority. If you're not going to cut off funding, there's no existential threat then the primary existential threat that the state can paint is the ethnic minority, right? Like you can say, you know the biggest problem is that this, like minority is here to implement Sharia law change our country. When that is the existential, I'm not the fact that we're going to lose your job and be an economic disarray. That becomes a primary concern. You need transformation. So now why this is effective, this is uniquely also nuanced. ",constructive1,4.0,yaellewis,round5,yaellewis_round5,1.0,79.0
1612,"is way worse because they're actually able to act upon it. They're the ones that hold the levers of power in society and the moment they get this narrative in their hands, they weaponize it in ways that perpetuate injustice in our society and far exacerbate inequalities. What am I talking about? I'm talking about things like Rajputs in Rajasthan being able to get reservations in government jobs and reservations in universities because they painted themselves as a classic, deserves these rights having been the historical landowners in Rajasthan. What happened then? Does that country, or that state, lower class people in that state completely shut off from government jobs, completely shut out of universities because it's a privileged entitlement that these Rajputs held. What I'm talking about as well is that parents who have privilege, who have resources, will try to continue the illusion of their children being special. They don't want their children's bubble to burst because that is when children have these mental health breakdowns. Poor people, after a certain stage, poor parents are unable to continue this illusion because they can't buy their children their way through life. At some stage, the compassionate work person who tells the child, ""You're special, you're special, you're special"" while they continue to fail, while society continues to beat them down, stops working. But when you're rich, when you're Lori Laughlin and then you can buy your daughter's way into college, that is when you're able to keep that illusion going, you're able to keep the bubble going. What happens when you spend all your money trying to keep that illusion going? What happens is you perpetuate and generate further social inequity. You then rig college admissions, which disables underprivileged people. For me, it was an access education that allowed them to get social mobilities. You ensure that people feel resentment against a political system that seems to be rigged against those who are lacking privilege. This is by far the most important thing in this because these are people who actually have power, who have the power to continue to oppress minority because they believe they have a birthright to something they really don't have one to. So I've already told you basically in my extension why this is the most important thing. ",constructive1,5.0,yashb99,round6,yashb99_round6,1.0,77.0
